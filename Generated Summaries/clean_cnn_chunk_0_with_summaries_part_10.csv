star michael vick is set to appear in court monday a judge will have the final say on a plea deal earlier vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in virginia your admitted conduct was not only illegal but also cruel and reprehensible your team the nfl and nfl fans have all been hurt by your actions nfl commissioner roger goodell said in a letter to vick goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over in papers filed friday with a federal court in virginia vick also admitted that he and two coconspirators killed dogs that did not fight well falcons owner arthur blank said vicks admissions describe actions that are incomprehensible and unacceptable the suspension makes a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the nfl will not be tolerated he said in a statement  watch what led to vicks suspension   goodell said the falcons could assert any claims or remedies to recover 22 million of vicks signing bonus from the 10year 130 million contract he signed in 2004 according to the associated press vick said he would plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture in a plea agreement filed at us district court in richmond virginia the charge is punishable by up to five years in prison a 250000 fine full restitution a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release the plea deal said federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines the defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense the plea agreement said in an additional summary of facts signed by vick and filed with the agreement vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won most of the bad newz kennels operations and gambling monies were provided by vick the official summary of facts said gambling wins were generally split among coconspirators tony taylor quanis phillips and sometimes purnell peace it continued vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by bad newz kennels  vick also agreed that collective efforts by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs around april vick peace and phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at vicks property in virginia the statement said peace phillips and vick agreed to the killing of approximately 68 dogs that did not perform well in testing sessions at 1915 moonlight road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods including hanging and drowning vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of peace phillips and vick the summary said peace 35 of virginia beach virginia phillips 28 of atlanta georgia and taylor 34 of hampton virginia already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences vick 27 is scheduled to appear monday in court where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge  see a timeline of the case against vick   the judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement the federal case against vick focused on the interstate conspiracy but vicks admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges according to cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin it sometimes happens  not often  that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior toobin said friday the risk for vick is if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea the state of virginia could say hey look you admitted violating virginia state law as well were going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court  in the plea deal vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests vick agreed to make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated with the dogs that are being held by the government such costs may include but are not limited to all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case including if necessary the longterm care andor the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals prosecutors with the support of animal rights activists have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs but the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against vick and his admitted coconspirators judge henry e hudson issued an order thursday telling the us marshals service to arrest and seize the defendant property and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property both the judges order and vicks filing refer to approximately 53 pit bull dogs after vicks indictment last month goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the falcons

holding out for 30700 for one of his kidneys doctors in pakistan have been arrested for abducting people drugging them and stealing their kidneys they are not so unusual a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with endstage illnesses to poorer places like china pakistan turkey egypt colombia and the philippines to buy a new lease of life lee a 53yearold chief subway technician in hong kong was diagnosed with liver cancer in january 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread a friend told him about a transplant hospital in chinas north eastern tianjin city and he signed up for a place that april he paid 260000 yuan 34380 for a transplant  surgery that saved his life the hospital has connections with a lot of prisons lee told reuters mine came from an executed prisoner from heilongjiang i thank the donor deeply the world health organization estimates that 21000 liver transplants are carried out annually but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90000 demand for kidneys also exceeds supply and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and transplant tourists who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living a donor in south africa receives 700 for a kidney compared with 30000 in the united states a lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on or at least regulate the trade but even where the trade is banned laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes which are sometimes defended by vested interests and the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor  especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donors liver the complications can include bleeding infection even death in the transplant trade the recipient need not worry about for example exposing a living relative to that risk it is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you dont have to care for someone you dont know once you pay it is discarded in a way it is dispensable said luc noel a genevabased coordinator for clinical procedures at the world health organization china recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year only 20000 transplants are carried out in china each year of these 3000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors china defended its use of organs from executed prisoners saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families a transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around 33000 in china what is important is the transparency it has to be open to scrutiny  if china makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent that would do good said the whos noel in asia a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs excluding china asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year said lo chungman professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the university of hong kong pakistan where trade in human organs is not illegal is turning into a kidney bazaar said the chief executive of pakistans kidney foundation jaffar naqvi there are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but naqvi said there were 13 centers in lahore alone which reported more than 2000 transplants last year from bought kidneys patients mostly from europe saudi arabia and india pay about 500000 rupees 8500 for a new kidney he said donors are paid 300 to 1000 and often get no medical care after the surgery there is no consent in some cases in may police arrested nine people four of them doctors for abducting people drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations in the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a nonrelative with no payment such a clause allowing altruistic organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors naqvi said stories of people selling their organs especially kidneys are not uncommon in egypt where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line karam who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure he said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30000 egyptian pounds 5300 the fees of the doctor were 5000 pounds both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the donor received said karam he said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients lists abdelkader hegazy head of the disciplinary committee at the doctors union said egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence the law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment we at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back he told reuters it is an annoying and a regrettable situation wellknown doctors and professors are doing this they are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values the union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities but the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years

a speech at a memorial service here is his speech in full  william and i can separate life into two parts there were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father princes harry and william greet guests at a thanksgiving service in memory of their mother and then there are the 10 years since our mothers death when she was alive we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life laughter fun and folly she was our guardian friend and protector she never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated she will always be remembered for her amazing public work but behind the media glare to us just two loving children she was quite simply the best mother in the world we would say that wouldnt we but we miss her she kissed us last thing at night her beaming smile greeted us from school she laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day she encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure she  like our father  was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood to lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age as others have experienced is indescribably shocking and sad it was an event which changed our lives forever as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night but what is far more important to us now and into the future is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was funloving generous downtoearth entirely genuine we both think of her every day we speak about her and laugh together at all the memories put simply she made us and so many other people happy may this be the way that she is remembered prince williams reading from st pauls letter to the ephesians  i bow my knees before the father from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name i pray that according to the riches of his glory he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his spirit and that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith as you are being rooted and grounded in love i pray that you may have the power to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of christ that surpasses knowledge so that you may be filled with all the fullness of god now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations for ever and ever amen thanks be to god the bishop of londons speech  whos cheating the scene is an old peoples home two residents are playing beggar my neighbor enter the princess the question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room one tiny incident characteristic of countless other occasions in the princesss public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort everyone here will have their own memories i remember meeting princess diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in st pauls even archbishops chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and i was nervous entering the presence it must have been a bewildering time for the princess as well but even then at the age of 20 her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated prince harry has spoken movingly and justly as few others have the right to do about the princess as a mother i want to dwell for a moment on her public work its cost and its meaning after her marriage the princess joined her natural gifts of beauty empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the royal family generates led by our queen and other members of the royal family our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century there is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but doesnt intrude but there is another sphere vital to any sense of national unity and creativity a sphere in which communities must be celebrated common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored we tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is gods will but if noone can articulate in an unignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in christ the human face of god then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society and at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech and the princess brought her own gifts to this work she was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the middlesex hospitals aids ward it was the first in the uk and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded aids in the 80s those familiar with the field have no doubt that the princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin and she had a similar impact in the usa an editorial in the new york times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign and even a royal dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the us her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the ottawa convention banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children she proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which of course have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries and as she said in her words the biggest disease today is not leprosy or tb but the feeling of being unwanted she sought out places of suffering because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way bill deedes accompanied her on some of her visits his response to the cynics was typically robust he said she was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well she was good at this because she herself was vulnerable she knew the feeling she didnt set out to be a saint the role brought great power but like any member of the royal family she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over ones personal humanity is a desperately difficult task as we have heard from prince harry his mother diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead she confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched she said of john a young greek suffering from cystic fibrosis he showed no sign of anger no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that i have never before encountered the love of christ described in the lesson read by prince william contains the essence of the spiritual life princess diana recognized this quality of life in many of those like john whose lives she touched it was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out and the mystery is this  the more you go beyond yourself the more you will become your true self the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others the more you will find yourself the more you keep company with those who suffer the more you will be healed this is the knowledge which passes all understanding this is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints its easy to lose the real person in the image to insist that all is darkness or all is light still 10 years after her tragic death there are regular reports of fury at this or that incident and the princesss memory is used for scoring points let it end here let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion let us also echoing the words of prince harry look to the future and pray in the words of st paul for all those who serve our country as members of the royal family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her  i pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of god amen email to a friend ,"prince harry describes princess diana as the best mother in the world

ddcdeb9bdd19fa23f9495c85d48eeee910f33102,washington cnn  a wideopen presidential race and a willingness by candidates interest groups unions and corporations to buy tv time will lead to historic spending for political and issueadvocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle an analysis shows former massachusetts gov mitt romney has spent the most on tv advertising so far among presidential contenders the cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed 3 billion according to tns media intelligencecampaign media analysis group cnns consultant on political television advertising this is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issueadvocacy television advertising rang in at 17 billion in 2006 23 billion was spent on political and issueadvocacy tv commercials just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money said evan tracey cmags chief operating officer the costs to produce a tv commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters  see how spending breaks down for this year   and interest groups have spent 62 million on tv ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures on the national level the cost of issueadvocacy television ad spending was 270 million in the first nine months of this year subjects ranged from the iraq war to telecommunications reform television ads on health care alone total 60 million cmag estimates more than 3 million of the 270 million spent to air issueadvocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive house and senate races in 2008 tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode what we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries and through the general election is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates he said with 17 democratic and republican candidates running for president cmag predicts that more than 800 million will be spent on tv ads in the battle for the white house up to now the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of iowa new hampshire and south carolina voters in some of the 20plus states holding nominating contests on february 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months former massachusetts gov mitt romney leads all candidates in tv spending having aired his commercials more than 11000 times this year at a cost of nearly 86 million this is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle  watch how romney is way ahead in ad spending   in contrast one of romneys chief rivals for the gop nomination former new york mayor rudy giuliani has spent nothing on television ads but giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition while romney does not in the race for the democratic nomination illinois sen barack obama has spent more than 23 million on television commercials while new york sen hillary clinton has spent 1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls new mexico gov bill richardson has probably benefited the most in the democratic contest from the 2 million he has invested in his television commercials richardsons humorous tv ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker diplomat and executive and positioned him as a solid secondtier candidate romney used his 86 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to republican voters these voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal massachusetts romney is leading polls in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire further evidence of how romneys television commercials have helped is in south carolina an american research group poll of south carolina republicans in august showed romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters a month later and with 350000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll romney was up 17 percentage points romneys latest ad began airing friday in iowa and in it he vows to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons to boost the military by 100000 people to strengthen us intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the us from al qaeda all of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the iowa caucuses while only a handful of democratic candidates and romney have used the airwaves until now tracey said he expects this to change before the end of october i suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air tracey said as we get closer to primary day the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last best shot in the fight for congress cmag predicts that as much as 639 million could be spent on television advertising democrats control the house and senate tracey noted that cmags 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former florida rep mark foleys house page scandal or the september 11 terrorist attacks politics is completely beholden to events he said events will ultimately determine how much is spent where and when what television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months chances are just as what happened in 2006 voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads said stuart rothenberg editor of the nonpartisan rothenberg political report the sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance after a while the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise email to a friend ,"amount almost

they tried to put the children on a plane to france where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in three french journalists a sevenmember spanish flight crew and one belgian were also arrested representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with zoes ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission chadian president idriss deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed his chief of staff mahamat hissene said thursday the president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of abeche where the children were taken to a judge in ndjamena the capital hissene said the transfer will take place monday according to media reports the international red cross committee the un high commissioner for refugees and unicef said most of the children were living with their families before zoes ark took them the charity said the children were sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a wartorn nation the agencies said most of the children also probably come from chadian villages along chads border with sudan the children have been living in an orphanage in abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities  watch a report on whether the children are orphans   chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities chads interior minister said zoes ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help the charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted the spaniards and belgian are charged with complicity the spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released a company executive said thursday we thought we were doing a humanitarian transport said antoni cajal sales director of spains gir

the first problem of its kind for the company which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue cajal said on its web site zoes ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in paris that sends teams of physicians nurses firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in france who then apply for asylum on their behalf the red cross unhcr and unicef said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10 and they are healthy the agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds so far the interviews carried out with the children  some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age  led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from chadian villages near the cities of adre and tine along the chadiansudanese border the agencies said ninetyone children said they had been living with their family consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent the agencies said adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing the agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children their youth and the situation in the region other french charities earlier had questioned whether zoes ark could legally arrange adoption of children from darfur and contacted french authorities according to french newspapers and the associated press french authorities have reacted angrily to the zoes ark trip calling the groups actions illegal and irresponsible

such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity even wonder perhaps but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer the island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier but such a large amount of ice melted it revealed the distinct island i very quickly realized two things he told cnns anderson cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year one was that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change the other thing was that it meant it was really happening it wasnt a joke it wasnt just statistics it was really happening he calls his discovery warming island many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the earths climate are the result of an increase in the worlds temperature a trend widely called global warming many global warming experts say the phenomenon if unchecked is capable of altering the worlds climate and geography in the worstcase scenario experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels flooding cities and altering seashores other scientists and observers a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planets life most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere but why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious the earths temperature averages about 60 degrees fahrenheit about 16 degrees celsius the average surface temperature has warmed one degree fahrenheit 06 degrees celsius during the last century according to the national research council the temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910 according to the us environmental protection agency they rose till about 1945 cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day there are several possible reasons for the warming scientists say a change in the earths orbit or the intensity of the suns radiation could change triggering warming or cooling the reason most cited  by scientists and scientific organizations  for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planets temperature at a comfortable level the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for instance has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age according to the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change commonly referred to as the ipcc the presence of methane is now 151 percent above preindustrial levels but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades according to the epa meanwhile nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities like the burning of fossil fuels emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests for the last 30 years theres no way theres anything natural that can explain it stephen schneider a professor of environmental studies at stanford university in california said a vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community  will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming he added many scientific organizations share schneiders view ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the g8 to the national research council the american meteorological society and the american geophysical union but there are those who do not share his view and among the skeptics is richard lindzen a professor of atmospheric sciences at the massachusetts institute of technology weve suddenly taken to reading tea leaves he said when we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970 we were proclaiming global cooling since then theres been a few tenths of global warming so were proclaiming global warming he believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal the earth is always getting colder and warmer he said its always changing in fact this is true of any fluidcovered planet asked about glacial melt which many observers point to as evidence of global warming lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained we dont know why but its perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that theyve occurred he said what were doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying thats occurring due to global warming yet for schneider it is a cause for concern and alarm were already in serious melt nobody can explain it the models dont predict it he said we dont know whats going on up there all we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty the greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the worlds nations the ipcc in february 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to preindustrial levels temperatures could rise between 36 to 81 degrees fahrenheit 2 to 45 degrees celsius by 2100 the lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes droughts wildfires and flooding schneider said the higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of hollywood filmmakers uncertainties however plague such forecasts which are based on computer simulations and models the models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere oceans and continents interact all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them exactly how much its going to warm up we dont know schneider said that its going to warm up id bet anything on that email to a friend ,"earth has warmed one degree

the perfect way to describe invisalign is netflix for your teeth is right  the things we do for beauty so how did you like being transformed into three such different looks kh it was fun i was working with such great hair and makeup people and to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat is do you ever go without makeup kh there was a time when i would now that i get followed by photographers im really paranoid about it i do not want to be the look what this celebrity looks like without makeup picture im clearly vain and i dont need that plus i like products is how often do you go through your drawers and purge kh often because people send me a lot of stuff now which is exciting i love getting those boxes into the tape recorder send me a box of makeup stila when that happens i feel like i have to clean out and give stuff to my sister mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that i cant accept is how do you think you express your personality through style kh im a big hairup person last night at work they put my hair in two french braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap i thought it looked cute and that i could pull it off after id slept on it and  no so i thought i could recreate it myself  no again as far as clothing style goes i fluctuate almost as much as i do with beauty products i like to shop for sweaters  maybe its the new englander in me im building a house in the mountains in utah so i tell myself im preparing for that i like sweaters  theyre like scrubs  you dont have to suck it in or worry about the bloat is do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding kh i have an idea but its so dependent on the dress and i havent gotten there yet my sister is getting married too so we looked for dresses together after about five stores i was like im done everyone says you just know when you put that dress on my sister found the right dress just like that so i know it can happen but its grueling is wait so your mom has two daughters getting married within months kh my poor mother is probably like why god why but i hired a planner i want the day to be spectacular but mostly i want it to be fun and i dont want to freak out or stress is does your fianc have any particular opinions about your look kh josh wouldnt mind if my hair was brown if it was still long  thats such a boy thing is would you ever wear a wig out kh id contemplate it but i dont know if i actually have the courage to pull it off i once wore a long hairextension ponytail and someone asked me if it was real like i was one of those dolls when we were little and the hair just cranks out is how would you describe your skin kh my skin is sensitive so everything bothers it and im the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse is how do you treat a breakout kh i got a great product at ona spa called sebuspot ive tried so many that were disappointments but maybe i stand too close to the mirror examining my pores if i backed up things might look fine is what do you always carry in your bag kh powder because i get shiny and lip balm either the smiths rosebud salve or co bigelows mentha lip shine in black cherry soda from bath  body works its shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good is an in stylecom reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in hollywood kh i train

up a huge outcry actors can be so touchy in response he issued this correction i have been misquoted what i really said is actors should be treated as cattle although it began accidentally when he was short an actor for the film the lodger hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career ayn rand  the egotists egotist author ayn rand born alissa zinovievna rosenbaum is the patron saint of thinking youre better than everybody else her most famous novels the fountainhead and atlas shrugged are massive dramatizations of objectivism her selfspun oscarthegrouch philosophy for success objectivism champions ego and accomplishment shuns all religion as folly and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society rands novels often focus on protagonists invariably men who are shunned by others because of their genius but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant not surprisingly she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as spitting in your own face so just how much did rand believe in her own philosophy lets

a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296,london england cnn  there are some circuits that are cornerstones of the formula 1 calendar the monacos and silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers then there are the newer circuits  malaysia and bahrain for instance  but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins fuji speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view next week they have something completely new to contend with a track that has yet to see a single f1 team put in a single lap the japan grand prix is to return to the fuji speedway a circuit that hasnt seen an f1 race since 1977 though now with a substantially different track layout the fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games the old fuji speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game pole position released by namco in japan and atari in the rest of the world the most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of mount fuji japans tallest mountain looming in the distance though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies the suzuka track  which had held japanese grands prix between 1987 and 2006  had been popular with drivers and fans alike but for this year and the next the japanese grand prix will be held at fuji however an announcement by formula one management fom this month revealed that suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009  on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications  with the location of the japanese grand prix alternating yearly between fuji and suzuka after that behind the scenes is a political battleground  both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with f1 connections  honda owns suzuka toyota owns fuji toyota is a relative newcomer to f1 but having this year surpassed general motors as the worlds number one automobile manufacturer and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock a position that hasnt been reflected in sporting success it is not without clout the redesign of the fuji track was carried out by hermann tilke in 2003 tilke a german architect redesigned a number of f1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including malaysia istanbul bahrain and shanghai and the tracks for 2008s debut grands prix in singapore and valencia so how do f1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as fuji without data from previous races to fall back on the answer lies with computer simulation computeraided design cad is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the hightech cars every bend every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself despite never having raced on the circuit the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual fuji speedway for some time bmw saubers simulation experts received cad data from the japanese race organizers late last year and when their cars arrive at fuji for testing next week their race setup should be close to optimum the circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments the radius of each individual segment was measured allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated the slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car in order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance says willy rampf technical director of the bmw sauber f1 team dieter glass chief race and test engineer with toyota f1 explains  you start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit once you know that you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce before you get into more detailed simulations of different setup solutions getting a bit closer to the weekend you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy this prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track like the degradation of the two bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time if you have more fuel in the car this affects your lap time but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried one peculiarity of the fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight which at 1475 km 0916 miles will allow for higherthan averagestraight line speeds but after the straight the track is relatively twisty the teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight and the best grip decelerating into the bends you have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip says glass and as always you want good grip in general but you have to balance that with the long straight where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed the testing may be virtual but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hairs breadth away from real world eventualities  our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values says rampf not that everything can be predicted i think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race continues glass many incidents can happen which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy email to a friend ,"redesigned fuji speedway to host its first japanese grand prix since 1977

hired a bodyguard for his sons wedding and never leaves home without a 45caliber handgun strapped to his chest keith reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case the man who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of keith reynolds for domestic abuse  even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family a report in the denver post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of colorado paul logli chairman of national district attorneys association told congress this year that witness intimidation has become almost epidemic according to the denver post when asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of colorados witness protection program the witness in the reynolds case said all they told us was maybe we should move im pretty sure i told one of them  either him or his wife  about the program i cant remember if i gave them all the details the prosecutor assigned to the case who didnt want to be named told cnn after reynolds conviction the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home they received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked the couple received a death threat from reynolds himself through the mail watch witness describe fear of being targeted   reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation however it is likely hell be released within five years no national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist and minimal research has been conducted on the subject the latest national institute of justice survey on record  conducted more than a decade ago  shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem colorado has 50000 allocated to its witness protection budget in contrast the city of denver spent almost 100000 on landscaping last year the state on average spends about 1000 per witness that figure supposedly includes moving expenses rent and furniture the federal program spends in excess of 40 million per year on witness protection one possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities as do federal witnesses its not designed to be a longterm relocation at the publics expense its a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses according to peter weir executive director of the colorado department of public safety colorados witness protection program is a joke according to the rev leon kelly founder and executive director of the open door youth gang alternatives kelly says the state doesnt provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward more than a decade ago a young man named darryl givens asked kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison givens chose to testify a few months later he

instantly rhonda fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program she confronted prosecutors after his murder fields told cnn i asked them what happened why werent any measures taken to safeguard his life and i was told he never asked for any protection javads mother does not think it was her sons responsibility to ask for protection i think its the authorities responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness she said fields case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting javad fields personal information be kept secret but it wasnt signed by a judge until one year later after defense lawyers had already given the suspects fields personal information along with crucial trial documents i felt like the das office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life rhonda fields told cnn

debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month with five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season the republican candidates engaged in a freeforall trying to differentiate their views on immigration the iraq war abortion gun control and even whether they believed every word in the bible was true unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on democratic frontrunner hillary clinton wednesday nights attacks were launched at each other former new york mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov mitt romney traded jabs over illegal immigration something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month romney attacked giulianis record saying that as mayor he promoted illegal immigration and giuliani shot back accusing romney of having a sanctuary mansion at his own home  watch the debate format produce raw moments   in his case there were six sanctuary cities he did nothing about them there was a sanctuary mansion  at his own home illegal immigrants were being employed giuliani said romney denied giulianis allegation and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other in his quest to appeal to the hardline immigration wing of the party romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former arkansas gov mike huckabee who has been rising in the polls rep tom tancredo who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration seemed delighted with the give and take saying the other candidates were trying to outtancredo him huckabee drew one of the nights largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the internal revenue service most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging and theres a reason why he said sen john mccain freshly back from a visit to iraq over thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates and rep ron paul the most antiwar of the candidates tangled on two occasions over the iraq war  did  youtubers get their questions answered   asked which government programs they would cut paul said bringing the troops home from iraq would save a trillion dollars mccain said its that kind of isolationism that caused world war ii which drew some hoots from the crowd  watch mccain paul spar on iraq   paul replied the real question you have to ask is why do i get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel a retired brigadier general keith kerr who is gay asked candidates if they thought us military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops cnn later learned that a june media release from the campaign of democratic  frontrunner clinton listed kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters  watch kerr deny that the clinton campaign influenced his question   david bohrman cnn senior vice president and executive producer of the debate said we regret this incident cnn would not have used the generals question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate political ticker  kerr told cnn after the debate that he has not worked for the clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself kerr also said he is a member of the log cabin republicans a national gay and lesbian republican grassroots organization prior to the debate cnn had verified kerrs military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate in a section of the debate about gun ownership rights three of the gop presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns mccain giuliani and romney former tennessee sen fred thompson quipped i own a couple of guns  but im not going to tell you what they are or where they are  watch the candidates address gun control   the debate turned personal when a viewer holding the bible asked do you believe every word of this book and i mean specifically this book that i am holding in my hand huckabee a baptist minister said sure i believe the bible is exactly what it is giuliani said he believes the bible but not literally true in every respect after that romney stammered a bit when moderator anderson cooper asked him if he believed every word  watch the candidates get personal about the bible   yeah the bible is the word of god  i might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word but i read the bible and i believe the bible is the word of god romney said when asked about abortion romney said he was wrong in favoring a womans right to choose  his position when he was elected governor of massachusetts if people in this country are looking for someone whos never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit theyre ever wrong theyre going to have to find somebody else on abortion i was wrong he said his remarks came in response to the 30second video produced for the debate by thompsons campaign which included a clip of romney expressing support for roe vs wade during a 1994 debate against sen ted kennedy when asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal  paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government we dont need a federal abortion police thats the last thing we need paul said he added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities on the issues of taxes thompson said hed never met a tax he liked ive got a taxcut bill on the table but i dont do pledges to anybody but the american people he said his response was met by a go fred go from a member of the audience on the issue of trade with china rep duncan hunter said china is cheating on trade  and its in the interest of the united states to stop chinas cheating buy american this christmas season  that might keep your neighbor from losing his job the

deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back mildred and eduardo gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported his wife faces deportation to guatemala  her home country that she hasnt seen since 1989 he also doesnt know what would happen to his young son eduardo jr if that happens i like being in uniform and serving my country but if she goes back im going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job he said defending the country thats trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind gonzalez who works on helicopters that bring cargo supplies and military personnel in and out of iraq testified before a house judiciary committee panel last month detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his where military members families could be deported while theyre defending their country overseas  watch theyre tearing families apart   i want to serve my country 100 percent but with this issue in the back of my mind i feel i cant do that he testified on september 6 the us military does not have a policy to deal with such cases each is handled casebycase not by the military but by immigration authorities the government doesnt have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar  to gonzalezs immigration officials also said marrying a us citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to us citizenship or permanent legal status lt col margaret stock a member of the us army reserves who teaches immigration law at the us military academy at west point new york said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members you got to understand when youre in a combat zone you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy you cant be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where youre never going to see them again she said stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases on the one hand the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas on the other hand the same government is trying to deport the very same people whats happening right now is because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws weve got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home she said in gonzalezs case his wife mildred came to the united states with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old they were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from guatemala in september 2000 mildreds mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application her mother was granted legal status in july 2004 according to gonzalez however six weeks earlier gonzalez and mildred got married canceling mildreds ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21 as a result her legal status still remains in jeopardy a judge in june granted her a oneyear extension to remain in the united states if her legal status does not change by june 8 2008 she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation thats just fine according to mark krikorian the executive director of the center for immigration studies which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration what youre talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces and thats just outrageous he said what were talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military  theres no justification for that kind of policy gonzalez said that type of response is unjustified im trying to make his country better  my country better  and it should be her country too gonzalez himself entered the country legally crossing the mexican border with his family when he was about 10 he joined the navy as a socalled greencard sailor and became a us citizen in july 2005 the military does accept some immigrants who arent us citizens i understand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained but on the other token there are times when the situation is just out of their reach gonzalez said his wife mildred added we didnt come here to break the law we just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else us army sgt emmanuel woko a member of the armys 2nd brigade 1st infantry division who faces his third tour in iraq understands just how gonzalez and his family feel his wife and children could be sent back to nigeria my heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to nigeria while i am deployed in iraq he said i am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought thats a sentiment echoed by gonzalez we are not asking for anything we are just asking for our families to stay with

lessons from katrina which we have put into effect here chertoff said first of all planning and preparation in advance for these kinds of challenges so that we have worked together and planned together with the defense department and with state authorities well in advance of the crisis thats been a big help here chertoff said  second we have really flooded the zone as quickly as possible by staging assets to deal both with the firefighting issue and with the response issue chertoff said chertoff said federal officials began discussing over the weekend the need to have fema ready and as we saw the evacuation issue becoming more prominent and the number of people seeking shelter becoming more prominent we sprang into action yesterday so weve been monitoring the situation continuously the presidents been on top of it weve been on top of it and were going to continue to stay ahead of this as far as we can chertoff said tuesday that he hadnt waited for the paperwork to be signed before staging assistance we have been moving cots blankets other supplies into the area of san diego so that we can handle any necessity for additional sheltering capacity he said weve also moved air assets to be poised to take flight when we do have the opportunity to deal with the fire once the winds begin to die down people left homeless by the fires can already go online to apply for federal

billington told cnn that the steroids came from doctors from friends even from steroids meant for horses he took them all took a terrible pounding in the ring and like his partner who died at age 39 in 2002 began taking extensive amounts of painkillers benoits death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled now known as world wrestling entertainment and the man who has ruled wrestling for years chairman of the board vince mcmahon mcmahon appearing with linda mcmahon his wife and wwe ceo told cnn nothing from the wwe under any set of circumstances had anything to do with chris benoit murdering his family how did we know chris benoit would turn into a monster read a full transcript of the mcmahons interview  vince mcmahon defended the organization saying its drugtesting policy was not just for show our policy stacks up just as well as anyone elses in sport although again emphasizing we are entertainment and no one in entertainment no one has this kind of wellness policy mcmahon said critics say mcmahon pushes his stars and nonstars works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling they say mcmahon only looks at his employees as commodities pawns in a huge business his businesses are quite successful about 16 million people a week tune into wwe tv shows two of their cable programs  raw and friday night smackdown  are weekly ratings giants payperview specials generate an average of 100 million per year when asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old vince mcmahon said each person in the wwe bore responsibility for their own lives  especially outside the arena if someone passes through our organization it is not our responsibility for

2006 more than 30 of the organizations wrestlers have been suspended including two since cnns interview with the mcmahons david black  who helped the nfl develop its drug program and now runs tests for the wwe  says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning but dr gary wadler a worldrenowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes says the wwe is not doing enough it certainly falls far far short of where it needs to be he said and there is a gold standard and i measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard and the wwe is miles

a twoyear suspension from competition if caught a second time they can be banned for life blacks programs test wrestlers four times a year the first is a baseline test according to the wwe black then tests for nonmedical uses meaning that if an athlete has a prescription he is cleared its just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program said travis tygart who heads the us antidoping agency mcmahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids he says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years  watch one of the new wwe stars talk about being straight edge   theres an

lebanese woman and her son run through west beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces we ran from school screaming forget the book bags classmates homework just run out of breath my knees giving way it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter  a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block the memory of that terrifying afternoon receded  until recently after more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction the bombings and assassinations have returned to beirut every time i hear of a new explosion i think of a frightened child sitting in darkness in 1988 i watched the last throes of lebanons civil war firsthand  and like millions of lebanese sad frustrated and often fearful  see a timeline of lebanons recent history   now i watch from another continent but i find those same emotions resurfacing the conspiracies the car bombs the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar the actors are like shadows from a long gone past they are grayer perhaps   those who have avoided assassination but the cast in lebanons tragedy has changed little in two decades then as now a presidential election is the setting and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set lebanon back 20 years  see bios of lebanons major players   in 1988 the presidents term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building compromise was nowhere in sight the west had abandoned lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors syria had its choice for president israel had its own allies  a foil for growing muslim radicalism the country was awash with weapons in his last act as president amin gemayel named fellow christian and army chief michel aoun as prime minister at a stroke he shattered the convention that a muslim hold that position muslims refused to serve in the cabinet and the country ended up with two governments aoun famously declared i am prime minister and six ministers in one aouns war of liberation against syria turned into defeat then he turned on fellow christians of the lebanese forces in the war of elimination when that failed the syrians drove aoun to take refuge at the french embassy in august 1990 i came to cnn as a world report panelist i tried to explain lebanons chaos the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians i had seen people killed in front of me children orphaned in seconds parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins so when i was offered the opportunity to stay at cnn i gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy but almost as i left the civil war was being laid to rest the various factions had fought each other to a standstill arab governments supported by the west helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by syrian influence peace came to lebanon but it would be five years before i returned in 1995 i went back and was stunned i kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants i couldnt believe that i could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another no longer did identity  christian muslim or druze  define where lebanese could go people mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubblebubble laughing at the same jokes it was as if lebanons divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser downtown beirut once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes was rocking to lebanese pop music the dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest european fashions and deluxe hotels lovers had returned to beiruts corniche overlooking the mediterranean for romantic strolls at sunset but the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement  and was overseen by a pax syriana as antisyrian sentiment grew so did political tensions on valentines day 2005 the corniche was once again rocked by an explosion  former prime minister rafik hariri was killed the symbolism left me speechless on the day of love lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history it had been widely expected that hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of syrian troops suspicion fell on damascus which vehemently denied involvement on march 14 martyrs square became a human sea of demonstrators muslims druze and christians alike demanding the truth but hariris death also exposed the fault lines that had broken lebanon a generation previously even after it withdrew its troops syria still had allies in lebanon one was hezbollah accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of us marines in beirut more than 20 years previously another was gen michel aoun now back from exile the same michel aoun who had defied syria in 1989 but who now made common cause with hezbollah against his fellow christians earlier this year i visited martyrs square the spirit of the cedar revolution had evaporated the place looked like a morgue antigovernment hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill as i passed through business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair i wondered if they sensed my disappointment my pain at watching beirut bleed again lebanons political actors now find themselves reenacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago once again the term of the president is approaching its end there is no agreement on his successor suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day and the questions haunts me will the countrys brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries email to a friend  cnns joe sterling david ariosto saad abedine

least 70 more firefighters were aided by resources from mexico the state and federal governments and even inmates from californias prisons san diego fire department battalion chief bruce cartelli described scenes of utter devastation with hundreds of homes lost and many hundreds of others damaged its probably the worst significant event in my career of 36 years he said it will not end  until

assets to get up and fight the fires  if the weather cooperates maybe we can turn the tide tomorrow officials have evacuated nearly 350000 homes in san diego county alone where the worst of the fires are blazing using us census bureau numbers from the 2000 census that could mean as many as 950000 were affected by the fires  watch evacuees shaken firefighters battling   in san diego county at least half a million residents had been ordered to find refuge in shelters schools and stadiums as fires pushed into new areas among the evacuees as more than 4000 military personnel from several bases in

afternoon for a firsthand look at the devastation i wanted to see for myself first of all how the shelter situation is in san diego what the fires look like up close chertoff told cnn the secretary said that the federal response to the wildfires is phenomenally better than the response to hurricane katrina in 2005 because we have been preparing and planning and training together for the last 2  years unlike in katrina  we have now built the process  and weve rehearsed it so when we take the field the team already knows what we need to do he said  see photos of the fires   and the scene at qualcomm stadium on tuesday did seem to live up to chertoffs expectations as volunteers cheerily handed out chairs food and water thirtyfour firefighters have been injured authorities said gov arnold

sallie krawcheck has made fortunes list of the worlds most powerful women every year since 2002  thats what sallie krawcheck does as chairman and chief executive of citi global wealth management she joined the banking industry as a research analyst but quickly rose through the ranks gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity along the way dubbed the mrs clean of wall street ms krawcheck was credited with restoring investors faith in analyst reports while head of retail brokerage firm smith barney she joined citigroup in 2002 and spent some time as chief financial officer before taking up her current role in march 2007 sallie krawcheck has been a regular entrant on fortunes list of the worlds most powerful women in business  in 2007 she made number 12 john defterios caught up with ms krawcheck in dubai he asked her for her views on the movement of capital outside the g8 canada france germany italy japan russia the united kingdom and the united states sallie krawcheck sk i think whats happening right now its fascinating because in the united states and in developed europe were having a liquidity crunch  someone might argue a liquidity crisis and in fact we are awash with liquidity in the middle east and in asia as well so theres really a bifurcation thats occurring in the world and if you think about oil doesnt even have to stay at the 90plus dollar level it is even at levels in the 70s 60s 50s 40s a tremendous amount of liquidity is being generated in these markets which is really being put back into the market yes the investments are going up globally but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region and so over time youre really going to see i think continue to see a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the middle east as well as to asia john defterios jd its coming almost as a perfect storm we have a sub prime crisis a 20 percent fall in the dollar in the last two years in this window of time is there a danger that the financial capitals build outside of wall street and it undermines its role sk i think there is no doubt that new york is losing its status as a financial capital of the world if you think about some years ago if you think about the internet bubble for example where it was new york and california wasnt it and you look at a whole range of reasons for it and the sub prime crisis perhaps the decline of the dollar perhaps but you have overlapping regulators in the united states you have very high taxes in the united states you have a very litigious environment in the united states and you have the emerging markets coming up so capital is being raised outside of the united states these things some of which are negative for the united states some of which are positive for the other regions is accelerating a shift that was underway from new york to london to hong kong to singapore and potentially to dubai as well jd some of the wealth funds are now on the radar of both wall street and capitol hill in washington you cant have your cake and eat it too you cant say i want some of that liquidity but i only want part of that liquidity what is the result of that do you think can you overregulate the sovereign funds sk oh i think you can overregulate the sovereign funds i think the same question can be asked of the private equity funds and the hedge funds as well where in a lot of countries the regulators have been struggling with the issue of here are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity and the concern is if gee these are going to be important going forward we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets but if we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market  to a market outside the united states or europe for example jd its fascinating because if you look at qatar or egypt or shanghai the stock markets have almost had like a one way path theres been some correction here in the middle east but what are we likely to see here stair steps up the ladder with some corrections along the way or an implosion because of the rapid gains sk i think youve got to separate the idea of whats going on in the real economies and whats going on in the market places they move together but sometimes they separate they diverge and they can diverge for a long period of time if you look at economic growth potential of the middle east of asia of latin america we feel very bullish about this and i was making the point earlier today china has been growing at 11 or 12 percent not for one year or two years but literally for 30 years for 30 years its been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see so say the same thing for the middle east the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward jd is wall street or for that matter london or any other financial center ready for a woman  for example in your case 14 trillion dollars of assets sk 18 thank you jd to run one of the major money center banks of the world im sure youre feeling this pressure even though youre young by international standards are we ready for a woman to take over a money center bank sk well it looks like the united states may be ready for a woman to take over as president so i think if were ready to potentially have a woman run the country i think we are getting ready as a country to potentially have a woman run a money center bank now you know the board wouldnt ask and i wouldnt accept but if you look across wall street there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are ceos who move along and i think its a very exciting development for the industry and for the country have your say email us at mmecnncom or send an ireport email to a friend ,"mme speaks

360df256327edcaf7ce0b99314adec8b0a2c5be6,editors note ann curley is the assignment manager for the cnn medical news unit she has been a type i diabetic for 40 years this is her story of life with diabetes ann curley uses a pump attached to a catheter in her body to monitor glucose levels and administer insulin cnn  when i was 7 years old my mom took me to the doctor because i had lost a lot of weight despite a voracious appetite my family had just moved from the san francisco bay area to pasadena california and this visit to the doctors office was my introduction to a man who would come to have a huge impact on my life his name was dr robert deputy and he was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes he spoke to me directly rather than to my mother and he asked me questions did i feel thirsty did i need to urinate during the night the answer to both questions was yes he asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate dr deputy told me and my mother that my body wasnt processing sugar properly i had diabetes that is how my 40year journey with diabetes began i was checked into a hospital to learn how to test my urine for sugar give myself injections of insulin follow a diabetic diet and control my diabetes i spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease and then they sent me home dr deputy would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how i was doing much to my parents chagrin  and to my delight  he wanted me to be self sufficient and responsible for monitoring myself i refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine this demand for self sufficiency turned out to be one of my best life lessons and not just for managing my diabetes while some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden i feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise it forced our family to eat healthily and it taught me about good nutrition  something i practice every day i know carbohydrate counts in most foods and i understand dietary concepts that most people dont even care about being active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar so when my urine tested positive for glucose my older sister robin was in charge of exercising me we had countless jumprope contests bike rides and rollerskating excursions keeping me and my three sisters active and fit and i felt like a little mad scientist using a test tube with drops of water urine and fizzy tablets to see if there was sugar in my urine fortunately over time technology improved first test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it but the truth is testing urine for sugar was a primitive method by the time sugar gets into the urine its a signal that the body doesnt have enough insulin to process sugar and the urine test didnt give an actual number for the amount of sugar in the urine it simply gave a color reading that corresponded with a range of how much sugar was present in the urine inaccurate was really an understatement when you talk about urine testing home blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s and they were a huge move toward precise control and management of diabetes with the kit the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood the blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading of the blood glucose within seconds while i initially balked at the idea of pricking my finger several times a day now i cant imagine not doing it in order to monitor what my blood sugar is doing the 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump this device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin the reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shunt so rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the bodys insulin patterns the pump drips insulin into the body to keep blood sugars constant then gives extra amounts with meals another lifealtering development in diabetes which i have discovered in the last year is the continuous glucose monitor or cgm this is a small device inserted into the tissue  usually the abdomen hip or leg  and it has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the bodys fluids the data is transmitted to a receiver and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels i have participated in clinical trials for three different cgm devices and i found them all to be quite accurate some sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump so you can use the reading to adjust and finetune the amount of insulin being pumped into the body the patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated but its amazing to be able to see constant readings and graphs of what your blood sugar is doing and better manage blood sugars cgm technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type i diabetes using whats called a closed loop system this means diabetics someday will be able to wear a pump that gathers data from a sensor so precise that the pump can be programmed to act on its own and make adjustments all by itself the current systems are open looped meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given the goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system and all the patient has to do is wear it once that technology is perfected this type of device would be implanted which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes i mentioned to my sister robin that i had tracked down dr deputy for this article she told me something i didnt know when i was 7 forty years ago before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare dr deputy told my parents that i would probably only live to the age of 20 or 30 which apparently  but not surprisingly  had the whole family freaked out i spoke with dr deputy who recently retired from his pediatric practice and he seemed to remember me when i asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival he said sadly at that time that was what we told parents back then  everything changes with time  diabetes leukemia  technology has changed with the pump and the equipment i think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong i know that i certainly am in fact i am hoping to live another 40 years email to a friend ,"cnn medical unit assignment manager ann

unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign democratic presidential hopeful barack obama is competing for the black vote with hillary clinton the concerts were meant to boost black voters support for his presidential nominee bid  the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar the ensuing controversy highlighted that obamas desire to unite disparate voting blocs  especially religious voters  under his umbrella of change is not without some serious pitfalls when the campaign announced the lineups for the threecity embrace the change gospel tour last week one name stood out to gay bloggers donnie mcclurkin the grammyaward winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice and that he was once involved with those desires and those thoughts but was able to get past them through prayer to say the least neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay lesbian bisexual and transgender community john aravosis a prominent gay blogger and cofounder of the web site americablog led the charge against the obama campaign writing that the illinois democrat was sucking up to antigay bigots and giving them a stage when the story bubbled up into the mainstream media it took the obama campaign by surprise obamas efforts in the palmetto state have overwhelmingly targeted africanamerican churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in south carolina from rival sen hillary clinton the campaign has vigorously promoted the candidates faith launching 40 days of faith and family in september which used bible study groups to tap into the black electorate campaigners have run three radio ads one of which called obama a christian family man that aired on gospel stations across the state earlier this month obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of greenville where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with christian vocabulary telling the crowd to much applause that i am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on earth after that appearance the obama campaign told cnn that republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values i think that what youre seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the 90s obama said at least in politics the perception was that the democrats were fearful of talking about faith and on the other hand you had the republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away but on tuesday obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows especially among blacks obama issued a statement saying i strongly disagree with reverend donnie mcclurkins views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the united states and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious african americans a september poll of african americans in south carolina by winthrop university and etv showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that sex between two adults of the same sex is strongly unacceptable obama held a conference call wednesday with joe solomonese president of the human rights campaign and announced that the rev andy sidden an openly gay south carolina pastor will appear at the same event as mcclurkin on sunday in columbia solomonese was not completely assuaged i spoke with senator barack obama today and expressed to him our communitys disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with reverend mcclurkin an antigay preacher who states the need to break the curse of homosexuality he said in a statement there is no gospel in donnie mcclurkins message for gay lesbian bisexual and transgender people and their allies thats a message that certainly doesnt belong on any presidential candidates stage the state newspaper in columbia reported friday that obama organized a conference call thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders after the call the south carolina gay and lesbian pride movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside sundays concert in columbia privately obama aides say they believe obama is a candidate of real transformational change and that uproars like the mcclurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences will obamas refusal to kick mcclurkin off the concert bill hurt him like many political squabbles despite the national story it depends how much the controversy resonates with

point in aviation history as airbus superjumbo became the worlds largest aircraft and the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration singapore airlines ceo chew choon seng named the jetliner the queen of the skies tom enders ceo of airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds and cnns richard quest who was on board the maiden flight said there was nothing quite like it the luxury on board he said sets a new standard for air travel its the quietest large passenger jet ever built inside and out it has a low fuelburn to reduce fuel use and emissions it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort but the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the singapore airlines a380 is its beyond first class cabins behind the sliding doors of the singapore airlines suites the wellheeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading french yacht designer jeanjacques coste theres a wide leather seat and alongside that a standalone bed this is two meters long with givenchy duvets and cushions and for couples traveling the beds on the middle two suites can be

first class menu that can be eaten off givenchy tableware unlike other airlines that have considered offering casinos gyms and showers on their future a380s singapore airlines has opted instead for a configuration that whilst offering luxury also makes money as chew choon seng ceo of singapore airlines reminded reporters last week the first boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats ranked 10abreast on the upper and lower decks as well as 60 business class seats that are

our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers it hasnt just been airbus that has been frantically preparing for the a380 launch airports around the world have had to

arrival of the a380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided as cnns richard quest points out while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly demand could be even higher for the mediumsize jets such as boeings upcoming 787 dreamliner as richard quest says theres no doubt the a380 will sell but it is going to take a

favor of the nominee despite questions about his views on waterboarding and the presidents power to order electronic surveillance sens dianne feinstein of california and charles schumer of new york

of the senate judiciary committee which is scheduled to vote on the mukasey nomination tuesday if all the republican members of the committee also vote for mukasey which is expected his nomination will go before the full senate a leading democrat speaking on condition of anonymity said wednesday mukasey is likely to be confirmed if his nomination passes the judiciary committee schumer had praised the nomination of mukasey as a consensus candidate when the president announced mukasey as his choice to replace former attorney general alberto gonzales gonzales gave up the post in september this is an extremely difficult decision schumer said when an administration so political so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge we are never left with an ideal choice judge mukasey is not my ideal choice however judge mukasey whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him is far better than anyone could expect from this administration a number of democratic senators however have said they will oppose mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called waterboarding and the presidents power to order electronic surveillance waterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning mukasey told senators this week that he finds waterboarding repugnant but he could not answer whether the technique amounts to torture while saying serious questions have been raised about judge mukaseys views on torture and on separation of powers feinstein said she would support the nominee because the justice department needed fresh leadership first and foremost michael mukasey is not alberto gonzales rather he has forged an independent life path as a practitioner of the law and a federal judge in the southern district of new york i believe that judge mukasey is the best we will get and voting him down would only

wish that i could support his nomination but i cannot america needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle  deeply embedded in our laws and our values  that no one not even the president is above the law president bush demanded the senate confirm mukasey during a speech thursday at the heritage foundation an influential conservative think tank in a time of war its vital for the president to have a full national security team in place the president said the president has equated asking mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the ciarun interrogation program whose details are classified bush said the program does not violate us bans on torture but added that mukasey does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy but leahy said judge mukasey was not asked to evaluate any secret facts and circumstances  he was asked whether waterboarding is illegal our law makes torture illegal and waterboarding is torture and it is illegal it is frankly not dependent on any quote relevant facts and circumstances of the techniques past or proposed use  he said quoting from mukaseys response to senators on the question sources with knowledge of the ciarun interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding but those sources have said waterboarding was used in the interrogation of khalid shaikh mohammed now facing trial before a military tribunal for planning al qaedas 2001 attacks on new york and washington the practice was used by the spanish

asked whether they prefer her or the gop frontrunner former new york mayor rudy giuliani but clintons path to the white house is in no way certain clinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week and her rivals for the democratic nomination have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on her position on iraq iran and other major issues the republican presidential

people  deserve a president of the united states that they know will tell them the truth and wont say one thing one time and something different at a different time edwards said edwards has also accused clinton of being a corporate democrat too willing to defend a corrupt washington establishement we desperately need in the next president someone that recognizes we have a system in washington

that a thirdparty candidate is more of an attempt to keep the nomination from me giuliani said you know it is a tactic and a legitimate one people have to think about that and consider it the lack of

1be68b94413120c0b2c7514ffd14b9cfc4413f90,tampa florida cnn  some christian congregations particularly in lower income urban areas are turning to an unlikely source for help  the church of scientology rev charles kennedy uses scientology founder l ron hubbards book during a friday night sermon scientologists do not worship god much less jesus christ the church has seen plenty of controversy and critics consider it a cult so why are observant christians embracing some of its teachings two pastors who spoke recently with cnn explained that when it comes to religion they still preach the core beliefs of christianity but when it comes to practicing what they preach in a modern world borrowing from scientology helps the rev charles kennedy of the glorious church of god in christ a pentecostal church in tampa florida and the rev james mclaughlin of the wayman chapel african methodist episcopal church in houston texas are among the theological hybrids  watch rev kennedy preach   they say they are not scared off by programs with ties to a church that critics say has aggressive recruiting secretive ways and rigid theology as men of god rooted in christian values they do not see scientology as a threat to their faith but rather as a tool to augment it scientology was founded in the 1950s by l ron hubbard a science fiction writer followers are taught that they are immortal spiritual beings called thetans although the church says there is a supreme being its practices do not include worshipping god im looking for solutions and the people that i help they dont ask me who l ron hubbard is said mclaughlin who works with addicts you know what they say thank god  critic rick ross a courtcertified scientology expert sees something more sinister at work he warned that mainstream acceptance makes it easier for the scientologists to achieve their ultimate goal  new recruits their hope is that through these programs people will become more interested in l ron hubbard what else mr hubbard had to offer and this will lead them eventually to scientology ross said the church has long been in the headlines for practices critics say are little more than cultlike mind control it is also known for its stable of devout celebrity followers and according to published reports scientology has been recently diversifying its outreach to include other religions and ethnic groups kennedy mclaughlin and a handful of other christian church leaders  no one can say how many  are finding answers to their communities needs in scientologys social programs for kennedy it began two years ago when he attended a meeting at the church of scientologys spiritual headquarters in clearwater florida he was introduced to a book called the way to happiness  hubbards 64page selfdescribed common sense guide to better living in the book which lays out ways to maintain a temperate lifestyle kennedy found a message he believed could help lift his predominantly lower income africanamerican congregation he said the books 21 principles help them with their struggle in an urban environment where there is too much crime and addiction and too little opportunity kennedy knew that before he could introduce any scientologyrelated text to his congregation he would have to prove that it did not contradict his christian beliefs and so he found scripture to match each of the 21 principles now kennedy uses the way to happiness as a howto supplement to his sermons he believes it is easier to understand and clearer to follow than ancient scriptures taken from the bible when asked whether scientologys values contradict the religion of jesus christ kennedy replies sometimes yes sometimes no but he says his congregation can relate to the way to happiness kennedy admits other pastors have criticized him but the disapproval is not enough to discourage him he insists that he has witnessed the changes the way to happiness has inspired in people he also maintains that the scientologists many of whom he calls friends are successful at outreach and getting desired results at kennedys c l kennedy center free tutoring based on hubbards study tech philosophies is provided to dozens of children and some adults kennedys daughter jimirra is one of the instructors she said study tech and the scientology orientation classes she attended helped her graduate from high school and become a poised woman though jimirra kennedy insists she does not ascribe to the religious side of scientology she still considers herself at least in part scientologist we say this all the time and i know my father says this but i am like a pentecostal scientologist thats what we are critics like ross are alarmed by such a blurring of the lines they consider it a marketing win for scientology in houston mclaughlin says he is not one to argue with success driven by a need to address the rampant drug problem in his community mclaughlin spent years searching for a solution before he discovered narconon scientologys nonprofit drug rehab center in 2001 mclaughlin trained at narconon and brought the techniques back to his community to launch first step faith step a program that combines hubbards methods with the teachings of christianity he claims a 70 to 80percent rehabilitation success rate kennedy and mclaughlin said they have never lost a member of their congregations to scientology i think that they truly believe that this may help their communities but in my opinion theyre nave ross said scientologists he added have their own agenda the church of scientology would not grant cnn an interview nor would its representatives answer questions about the hubbardbased programs  email to a friend ,"christian pastors borrow ideas from scientology to

6ef705715b84a961f971d624e9574da6a65dd3ef,cnn  it may take a lot of frequentflier miles a penchant for cold places a tolerance of taxes and regular doses of chocolate but happiness could be within reach however its not where most people might expect journalist eric weiner says he wanted to explore the relationship between place and happiness just ask eric weiner who made it his mission to find the most content places around the globe uncovering lots of surprises along the way hungering for a tropical paradise a warm climate doesnt necessarily make a happy nation weiner said thinking of moving to a wealthy state money can degrade happiness he found weiner who wrote the book the geography of bliss one grumps search for the happiest places in the world began his quest for very personal reasons im an unhappy person so its kind of what prompts a hungry person to search for food he said weiner spent 10 years as a foreign correspondent for national public radio a job that took him to some of the least happy places in the world it was enough to send him on a yearlong journey to look for just the opposite weiner mapped out his quest with a combination of scientific and personal methods choosing some countries because they traditionally score high on happiness surveys and selecting others to see how factors like money play a role a world map of happiness based on 100 different studies and produced by britains university of leicester in 2006 listed denmark as the worlds happiest nation but for weiner the place where he felt the most bliss was a tossup between bhutan and iceland countries that ranked eighth and fourth respectively on the happiness map weiners list of favorites also included thailand india and switzerland  see photos of his favorites and listen to him explain why theyre happy   his top two picks though very different countries have unconventional paths to happiness he said bhutan is probably the closest thing on earth to shangrila that fictional paradise weiner explained he pointed out that while other countries focus on their gross domestic product the himalayan kingdom proudly touts its policy of gross national happiness the bhutanese very much believe that happiness should be part and parcel of every government decision weiner said cold place warm relationships  thousands of miles away weiner found happiness in a very different environment marveling at the creativity and coziness of iceland everyone in iceland is a poet weiner recalled he visited the country during winter and said he found a certain beauty in the  cold and the darkness such a chilly climate usually encourages warm relationships weiner found the cold inspires people to cooperate traditionally if you go back a few hundred years people in cold climates have to cooperate or they die together its that simple he said weiner found a different flavor of happiness in switzerland where he discovered people are content partly because everything runs like clockwork simple pleasures like trains arriving on time contributed to national happiness he said but there may be a much sweeter reason why switzerland is a happy place the swiss eat a lot of chocolate and lets not forget that weiner said he was also impressed with how the swiss view money their attitude is that if youve got it hide it while our attitude is if youve got it flaunt it weiner said comparing the swiss to americans weiner called the united states which came in at no 23 on the university of leicesters world map of happiness a nation that is not as happy as it is wealthy the impact of wealth and taxes  the relationship between money and happiness took weiner to the middle east and qatar a country with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world thanks to oil and natural gas revenues according to the cia world factbook i went there specifically to examine what happens when the entire country wins the lottery weiner said he found the wealth made the residents comfortable but also degraded their level of contentment most of our happiness is derived from our relationships with other people weiner said the money in qatar has allowed them to wall themselves off literally and figuratively from other people  thats not a recipe for happiness there are no income taxes in qatar but thats not a cause for contentment weiner found some taxation is necessary for happiness because its a way of being invested in a place he argued youre giving money to someone else a government and youre trusting them to do something good with it weiner said in a country where theres no taxation at all people dont have vested interests in how well the government performs you cant say hey those are my tax dollars at work quest creates buzz  weiners book has struck a chord recently rising to the top 10 of the new york times nonfiction bestseller list an expert who studies happiness said part of the books appeal may lie in how weiner mapped out his journey he arranges an interesting itinerary because he uses science as his compass said daniel gilbert a psychology professor at harvard university and the author of stumbling on happiness gilbert said its only recently that a combination of biology sociology and psychology has been able to answer the wheres and whys of happiness a subject that has always fascinated people the quest for happiness is the central preoccupation of human beings and has been for as long as there have been human beings gilbert said he echoed weiners findings that bliss is other people everyone has been telling us for the longest time that happiness is about social relationships well bingo theyre right gilbert said meanwhile after a year of exploring some of the worlds happiest places weiner  the selfdescribed grump  said his mindset has improved somewhat i would describe myself as a recovering grump weiner said at this point i think i am marginally happier than before i started the project email to a friend

e3f24714630bd679c4b4fdb77e90f785beb1ff33,cnn  a saudi arabian human rights attorney is asking the government to allow him to represent a woman who was gangraped  and then sentenced to prison for speaking out about the case human rights groups want saudi arabias king abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim the attorney abdulrahman allahim had his license revoked last week by a judge for speaking to the saudicontrolled media about the case allahim told cnn the judge more than doubled the sentence against allahims 19yearold client because she spoke to the media about the case a court source told arab news an englishlanguage middle eastern daily newspaper the woman  who was initially sentenced in october 2006 to 90 lashes  had her sentenced increased to 200 lashes and was ordered to serve six months in prison under saudi arabias strict islamic law we were shocked allahim said of the increased sentence cnn has been unable to reach saudi government officials for comment on this report despite repeated requests  watch the emotional toll the crime took on the rape victim   allahim had petitioned the court to sentence the attackers to the death penalty but instead the court agreed to increase their jail sentences which had been two to three years to two to nine years allahim said the case has sparked outrage among human rights groups barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself said fawzeyah aloyouni founding member of the newly formed saudi association for the defense of womens rights this is not just about the girl its about every woman in saudi arabia she said were fearing for our lives and the lives of our sisters and our daughters and every saudi woman out there were afraid of going out in the streets human rights watch said it has called on saudi arabias king abdullah to immediely void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer the woman who is married and an unrelated man were abducted and she was raped by a group of seven men more than a year ago the lawyer said the male victim was also given an increased sentence of 200 lashes and six months in prison allahim said the man and woman were attacked after they met so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him according to allahim citing phone records from the police investigation allahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client he noted the photo she was trying to retrieve was harmless and did not show his client in any compromising position allahim said the man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day it is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under saudis islamic law allahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of justice next month where he faces a possible threeyear suspension and disbarment according to human rights watch he told cnn he has appealed to the ministry of justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with justice minister abdullah bin muhammad bin ibrahim al alsheikh currently she doesnt have a lawyer and i feel theyre doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights he said we will not accept this judgment and ill do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place he said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the saudi king earlier this month the ministry of justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because i consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that king abdullah bin abdulaziz started and against saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions he said saudi arabias islamic law or sharia is not written and therefore subject to a wide array of interpretations human rights watch points out that a judge in jeddah threw out a lawyer simply because he was a member of the ismaili faith a branch of shia islam under saudi law women are subject to numerous restrictions including a strict dress code a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a mans permission to travel or have surgery women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man and they are not allowed to vote the saudi government recently has taken some steps toward bettering the situation of women in the kingdom including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases adoption of a new labor law that addresses working womens rights and creation of a human rights commission christoph wilcke of human rights watch praised the female rape victim and her attorney for speaking out about the case which he said may be indicative of many injustices that we still dont know about its not only one court it is the saudi government that is fully behind punishing a woman whos been raped and punishing the lawyer whos trying to help her and doing that both because theyve spoken to the media wilcke told cnn and if they hadnt spoken to the media we wouldnt know about it shying away from criticism of key ally state department spokesman sean mccormack called the case and the punishment surprising and astonishing while this is a judicial procedure  part of a judicial procedure  overseas in courts outside of our country still while it is very difficult to offer any detailed comment about this situation i think most people would be quite astonished by the situation  mccormack said i cant get involved in specific court cases in saudi arabia dealing with its own citizens but most people here would be quite surprised to learn of the circumstances and then the punishment meted out he said email to a friend  cnns saad abedine and mohammed jamjoom contributed to this report ,"woman sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail under islamic law

she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial lisa nowak accused of using pepper spray against a romantic rival is set to go on trial in april ninth judicial circuit judge marc lubet ruled that all were unlawfully obtained he said his decision stemmed from a variety of factors most concerning police tactics in their interview of lisa nowak and the fact that no written consent was obtained to search her car in each and every case this court must ensure that the constitutional protections afforded by our forefathers are scrupulously honored lubet wrote in his opinion

her car were made under duress during a hearing held in august lubet heard testimony from among others nowak shipman and orlando police detective william becton who interviewed nowak after her arrest lubet said in his ruling that when nowak asked becton if she needed an attorney during the interview he failed to answer her question in a simple and straightforward manner there was a concerted effort to minimize and downplay the significance of the miranda rights by referring to these constitutional rights as formalities  during the interview lubet wrote on the audiotape of the interview there was no audible response from nowak on whether she understood that her statements could be used against her in court and when she was asked whether anyone had threatened or promised her anything to get her to talk to police lubet wrote thus there is nothing in either the audio recording or the transcript of the interview that demonstrates that defendant understood these two rights and waived them nowak testified at the august hearing she did not respond to bectons questions because she was confused lubet wrote in addition he said becton used legally impermissible statements and techniques including threats to get nowaks statements and consent well what you say can change what youre charged with becton said at one point right now were looking at a possible life felony of carjacking in a written statement an orlando police department spokeswoman said it was inappropriate for the department to comment on the case since it is pending in court and referred questions to prosecutors lubet noted that although nowak was given the opportunity to use the restroom and was asked if she wanted something to eat she was subjected to a barrage of questions beginning in the predawn hours and was questioned for six hours without being given the opportunity to sleep or make a phone call defendant had not slept during the preceding 24 hours the judge said nowaks consent to search her car lubet wrote followed illegal police activity such as a prolonged detention threats to obtain a warrant and repeated requests for consent prosecutors accuse nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from houston to orlando  wearing nasa diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make  and donning a disguise before following shipman from baggage claim to a parking lot her attorney has strongly denied that she wore the diapers shipman told police that after she got into her car nowak feigned distress and knocked on the window when shipman cracked it to talk to her nowak sprayed her in the

benazir  bhutto and the turmoil in pakistan could refocus voters on who is best qualified to deal with crises in other parts of the world my theme has been throughout this campaign that i am the one

to clintons yes vote on the iraq war she was a strong supporter of the war in iraq which we would submit is one of the reasons why we were diverted from afghanistan pakistan and al qaeda who may have been players in this event today so thats a judgment shell have to defend said obama adviser david axelrod the clinton campaign said the suggestion that her vote caused unrest in pakistan is baseless

lebanese woman and her son run through west beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces we ran from school screaming forget the book bags classmates homework just run out of breath my knees giving way it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter  a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block the memory of that terrifying afternoon receded  until recently after more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction the bombings and assassinations have returned to beirut every time i hear of a new explosion i think of a frightened child sitting in darkness in 1988 i watched the last throes of lebanons civil war firsthand  and like millions of lebanese sad frustrated and often fearful  see a timeline of lebanons recent history   now i watch from another continent but i find those same emotions resurfacing the conspiracies the car bombs the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar the actors are like shadows from a long gone past they are grayer perhaps   those who have avoided assassination but the cast in lebanons tragedy has changed little in two decades then as now a presidential election is the setting and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set lebanon back 20 years  see bios of lebanons major players   in 1988 the presidents term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building compromise was nowhere in sight the west had abandoned lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors syria had its choice for president israel had its own allies  a foil for growing muslim radicalism the country was awash with weapons in his last act as president amin gemayel named fellow christian and army chief michel aoun as prime minister at a stroke he shattered the convention that a muslim hold that position muslims refused to serve in the cabinet and the country ended up with two governments aoun famously declared i am prime minister and six ministers in one aouns war of liberation against syria turned into defeat then he turned on fellow christians of the lebanese forces in the war of elimination when that failed the syrians drove aoun to take refuge at the french embassy in august 1990 i came to cnn as a world report panelist i tried to explain lebanons chaos the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians i had seen people killed in front of me children orphaned in seconds parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins so when i was offered the opportunity to stay at cnn i gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy but almost as i left the civil war was being laid to rest the various factions had fought each other to a standstill arab governments supported by the west helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by syrian influence peace came to lebanon but it would be five years before i returned in 1995 i went back and was stunned i kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants i couldnt believe that i could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another no longer did identity  christian muslim or druze  define where lebanese could go people mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubblebubble laughing at the same jokes it was as if lebanons divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser downtown beirut once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes was rocking to lebanese pop music the dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest european fashions and deluxe hotels lovers had returned to beiruts corniche overlooking the mediterranean for romantic strolls at sunset but the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement  and was overseen by a pax syriana as antisyrian sentiment grew so did political tensions on valentines day 2005 the corniche was once again rocked by an explosion  former prime minister rafik hariri was killed the symbolism left me speechless on the day of love lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history it had been widely expected that hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of syrian troops suspicion fell on damascus which vehemently denied involvement on march 14 martyrs square became a human sea of demonstrators muslims druze and christians alike demanding the truth but hariris death also exposed the fault lines that had broken lebanon a generation previously even after it withdrew its troops syria still had allies in lebanon one was hezbollah accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of us marines in beirut more than 20 years previously another was gen michel aoun now back from exile the same michel aoun who had defied syria in 1989 but who now made common cause with hezbollah against his fellow christians earlier this year i visited martyrs square the spirit of the cedar revolution had evaporated the place looked like a morgue antigovernment hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill as i passed through business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair i wondered if they sensed my disappointment my pain at watching beirut bleed again lebanons political actors now find themselves reenacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago once again the term of the president is approaching its end there is no agreement on his successor suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day and the

percent of the population is out of a job it predicted the figures would rise if the restrictions continue a report monday from the un development program spotlighted the pressures on private

star witness of the london inquest now in its fourth month his role as confidant to diana who died in a paris car crash on august 31 1997 along with her boyfriend dodi fayed and hotel security chief henri paul meant his testimony was eagerly anticipated burrell whom the late princess once called my rock cast doubt on whether diana was ready to marry fayed according to burrell the princess was still holding a candle for former boyfriend and heart surgeon hasnat khan  who she called her soulmate  when she started dating fayed on the rebound burrell told the inquest that diana asked him to listen in on a conversation in june 1997 with her mother frances shand kydd who died in 2004 and who was critical of her relationship with muslim men  she called the princess a whore and she said that she was messing around with effing muslim men and she was disgraceful and said some very nasty things burrell said he agreed that as a result of such calls diana decided not to talk to her mother again the inquest which began in october and is expected to last another two or three months aims to uncover the facts surrounding the deaths of the princess and dodi and determine their cause of death  whether by accident or otherwise asked earlier in the day if he believed that fayed was the one burrell said no i did not have that impression he also cast doubt on claims that fayed and diana were engaged or on the cusp of engagement saying i find that difficult to believe asked to explain himself burrell said because this was only a 30day relationship and the princess had just finished a longterm relationship with someone khan she cared deeply about i knew that because i was there and i saw it dianas 18month relationship with khan ended around the same time she started seeing fayed in july 1997 burrell said diana had asked him at one point to investigate how a private wedding with khan might take place given that khan is muslim  watch report on claims about dianas marriage plans

before her death burrell said he suggested to the princess that she wear it on the fourth finger of her right hand rather than the left as is customary with engagement rings i need marriage like a bad rash burrell claimed diana told him last month at the inquest lady annabel goldsmith a friend of diana said the princess had remarked that she needed another marriage like a rash on my face burrell also indicated that the ring was not an engagement ring as the fayed family has maintained fayed family spokesman michael cole testified last week that dodis father mohamed al fayed was certain the couple had planned to marry lawyers at the inquest asked burrell whether he knew whether a special announcement had been planned for the monday following the fatal car crash there has been speculation the couple planned to announce special news such as an engagement but burrell said he knew nothing of such a plan he said he had actually looked at dianas schedule for that day and found only mundane items and nothing to indicate she planned a special announcement burrell also told the inquest he did not believe prince philip queen elizabeths husband was involved in dianas death mohamed al fayed father of dodi and the owner of harrods department store has long claimed that senior members of the royal family  specifically the queens husband prince philip  ordered the pair be murdered he also claims that diana was pregnant at the time of her death but burrell said that he knew prince philip very well and that he could not have been behind the deaths i can tell you that is not prince philips nature  he said plus the princess was the mother of his grandchildren why would he want to harm her its not possible the inquest has seen and heard about correspondence which prince philip sent to diana with some witnesses claiming that he wrote cruel and hurtful letters but other correspondence shown to the jury appeared to be friendly and was affectionately signed pa burrell explained that philip could sometimes come across as terse because he says what he thinks prince philip doesnt mix his words burrell said he says it as it is but he is not a nasty man prince philip isnt known for his diplomacy he was fond of the princess burrell worked for the british royals for 21 years and became close to diana after her separation from prince charles he has written two books about his time with the princess in his second book burrell told of a letter from diana which indicated she feared for her life the princess wrote that prince charles planned an accident in my car brake failure and serious head injury one of dianas close friends however testified last month that she believed the letter could have been forged lucia flecha de lima said on december 18 that burrell was capable of imitating the princesss handwriting lawyers questioned burrell about the date of the letter burrell said it was written in october 1996 two months after diana and charles divorced  yet the letter refers to charles as my husband burrell responded that diana always referred to charles that way even after the divorce the inquest has revealed that diana was a prolific letterwriter who also received a lot of correspondence witnesses including burrell recall that the princess kept the letters in her desk with the more important ones stored in a special box burrell testified that after dianas death her mother frances shandkidd worked every day for a week shredding the papers from dianas desk he said he expressed concern about the shredding during a meeting he had with the queen on december 19 1997 it was at this meeting that queen elizabeth told burrell there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge that comment which has been widely reported was meant to warn him to be careful burrell said and was not a warning about any one person or group of people at the same meeting burrell also told the queen that he had taken some of dianas belongings

industry representative said monday an american airlines passenger complaining that she was having trouble breathing died on a flight last week jill drake a marketing representative for medaire inc said its physicians last year advised 74 airlines on how to handle more than 17000 inflight medical events flight attendants with sick passengers call good samaritan hospital in phoenix arizona a levelone trauma center where emergency room physicians and a service able to translate 140 languages are on call to answer questions from any of 2 million airline passengers flying at any given time she said very rarely does the call result in a diversion a decision made not by the doctor but by the pilot who must consider a number of variables beyond the passengers health she said the pilot must weigh weather conditions remaining fuel and proximity to an airport as of 1 pm 3 pm et monday medaire had fielded 110 calls which is a very busy day for us she said on average the company gets about 50 inflight calls from commercial airliners for an entire day and an additional 25 or 30 calls related to events that occur at airport gates or aboard yachts and commercial ships she said airlines contracting with medaire include continental southwest and british airways american has its own inhouse medical team drake said medaires doctors documented 97 onboard deaths in 2007 down from 110 in 2006 the top categories of inflight illness are fainting gastrointestinal problems respiratory issues such as shortness of breath heart problems ranging from arrhythmias to arrest and orthopedic problems such as broken bones drake said by law usbased commercial airlines must carry automatic external defibrillators oxygen and medical kits some airlines choose to carry extra nonmandated medications if a passenger already has breathing problems airplane travel will only worsen the condition because cabins are typically pressurized at 8000 feet said drake her advice to anyone not feeling 100 percent do not travel and anyone with a medical condition who travels should pack any critical medications in a carryon bag she said though flight attendants are trained to handle onboard emergencies they are not medically trained she said to think that they are going to be able to assist your every need thats quite a high expectation hydration and moderation are key and passengers should carry water and a snack she said vacationers often return home from tropical locales sunburned and in some cases drunk altitude amplifies the buzz drake said you have a couple of cocktails in denver you feel it a little bit more than in omaha denvers altitude is 5280 feet omahas is 1040 feet flying in a fresh cast can also prove dangerous your arm could expand and it could cut off your circulation she said noting that the risk is reduced with older casts which have typically already expanded to accommodate any swelling though the faa began demanding that airlines carry certain medications more than 30 years ago the list was tiny during the 1990s overseas airlines began carrying more sophisticated equipment and pressure increased for usbased airlines to follow said dr russell rayman executive director of the aerospace medical association which has roughly 3000 members including physicians research scientists and flight nurses congress held hearings and then required airlines carry more robust kits and defibrillators by 2004 american airlines was among the first to do so said dr david mckenas who served for 10 years as the airlines corporate medical director until 2002 he lauded the defibrillator as so good its like 100 cardiologists in a box the machine will only work if the patients heart is fibrillating a condition where the contractions become so irregular it loses its ability to pump blood efficiently american airlines buys its kits from banyan international corp which describes itself as the nations leading provider of emergency medical kits each of the ninepound 250 kits includes aspirin alcohol swabs nitroglycerine tablets antihistamines iv tubing a stethoscope a bloodpressure gauge a bronchodilator syringes gloves saline solution epinephrine dextrose a manual resuscitation bag alcohol pads and shears oxygen comes in several forms aboard planes the oxygen that flows into masks stored above individual seats is not medical oxygen and would not suffice for a passenger in an inflight medical emergency said rayman flight attendants have portable bottles of oxygen that they are to use for themselves in the event of a cabin decompression it could be used if there is a medical emergency on board but thats not its purpose he said more oxygen is stored in the cockpit for the pilots though medaire keeps track of its clients medical air incidents rayman criticized the faas failure to do so there is no central repository where these things can be archived and then retrieved he said they dont want to report it because it just doesnt look good its not good pr you could say he said even an anonymous registry would serve a useful purpose were concerned for safety on the flight faa spokeswoman alison duquette

we are mixed and we are many things said phillip rodriguez a documentary filmmaker many of his films such as los angeles now and brown is the new green george lopez and the american dream explore the experience and identity of latinos in the united states latinos very often dont share language dont share class circumstances dont share education its very difficult to speak about them as one thing he said from a census standpoint being of hispanic or latino origin means a person identifies himself in one of four listed categories mexican puerto rican cuban or other spanish hispanic or latino origin in the latter more openended category respondents can write in specific origins such as salvadoran argentinean or dominican according to a pew hispanic centerkaiser family foundation survey in 2002 that is how most latinos choose to identify themselves when asked which terms they would use first to describe themselves 54 percent said they primarily identify themselves in terms of their or their parents country of origin about one quarter choose latino or hispanic and 21 percent chose american but the broader terms  latino hispanic  are the ones tossed about when the media want to discuss a trend among latinos or when a politician appeals to the hispanic vote the us government came up with the term hispanic in the 1970s to generally refer to people who could trace their origin to spanishspeaking countries the term latino refers to origins from latin america which includes nonspanish speaking countries like brazil the terms are often used interchangeably which is a point of

because i dont believe that spain was the best thing for latin america for methere is no such thing as a latino identity said suzanne oboler professor of puerto rican and latino studies at john jay college at the city university of new york theres certainly a cultural understanding and a political identity she said noting that the many different groups will join on particular issues such as immigration and wages but she stressed that it was not a homogenous group not all latinos speak spanish for example not all latinos are going to vote democratic all latinos are not immigrants others such as carl j kravetz a longtime veteran of hispanic marketing said similarities among the different subsets of latinos do show a latino identity one partly fused through the groups experience in the united states kravetz heads a los angelesbased hispanic advertising agency called cruzkravetz ideas the association of hispanic advertising agencies embarked on a latino cultural identity project last year  when kravetz was the organizations chairman  to better understand a group of consumers they felt could not be adequately reached through the traditional spanishlanguage market there is very definitely a latino identity kravetz said it is drawn along parallels in values and ways of thinking and regardless of country of origin the group tends to cluster in a few areas he said those areas include interpersonal relationships latinos tend to emphasize family individuality is not as important perceptions of time and space they have longer time horizons and have a relaxed sense of privacy and spirituality religion and spirituality have a strong influence on latino life and perception of the world david chitel the founder of new generation latino consortium a group of advertising and media companies also said there are definite cultural ties among latinos particularly between those born in the united states so much so he said that he and others coined the term new generation latinos to refer to them were talking about people that have grown up here in the us in latino households most likely with their parents speaking spanish at home eating certain foods at home certain values and traditions that are instilled in them from music to religious beliefs to the importance of family these sorts of things chitel said and it creates very much an identity that is latino

interview on us television bhutto sits on stage at a campaign rally minutes before her assassination for standing up outside the car i think it was she to blame alone  nobody else responsibility is hers the former general told cbs 60 minutes on sunday bhutto was killed december 27 in rawalpindi south of the pakistani capital islamabad while she was standing in an armored moving car after rallying supporters for nowpostponed parliamentary elections her head was above the roof and unprotected at the time of the attack the cause of her death is not clear a bomber blew himself up near bhuttos limousine and videotape showed a gunman present though no autopsy has been carried out asked if bhutto could have been shot musharraf said yes absolutely yes possibility he has said he welcomes an international investigation musharraf who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security to bhutto who was seeking to regain the post of prime minister he noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and was given more security than any other person asked about the hunt for al qaeda leader osama bin laden widely rumored to be in the remote border region between pakistan and afghanistan musharraf said there is no proof whatsoever that hes here we are not particularly looking for him but we are operating against this  and al qaeda and militant taliban and in the process obviously it is combined maybe we are looking for him also and pakistans ambassador to the united states mahmud ali durrani told cnns late edition with wolf blitzer that if we knew where he was we would have taken him out durrani added that musharrafs comment about not specifically looking for osama means that the pakistani military is totally focused on destroying al qaeda and the taliban network and not just one person about bhuttos death he noted only that the investigation is not completed and we should not jump to conclusions still he added if she had not come out of the vehicle the protected and armored vehicle maybe we would have seen her smiling face again today though musharrafs popularity at home has plummeted he retains support from gop presidential contender sen john mccain i think hes a good man the arizonan told nbcs meet the press but i think hes made mistakes dont get me wrong and weve got to move forward with these elections and have them free and fair but i can work with him he understands the threat to his country that the taliban and al qaeda present and radical islamic extremists hes a very smart man hed be one of the first to go theyve tried to kill him nine times ok nine times theyve tried to kill musharraf hes not their favorite guy the new york times reported sunday that the bush administration is considering expanding covert operations in the western part of pakistan to shore up support for musharrafs government and to find bin laden and his second in command ayman alzawahiri democratic presidential candidate bill richardson of new mexico told cnns late edition with wolf blitzer that though he had not heard details of the plan it sounds like a strategy that makes sense he added we have got to take whatever action is needed richardson has called for musharraf to step down and has called for free and fair elections what we need to do is ask musharraf push him push him to step aside for the good of the country because he is widely unpopular he told cnn sen hillary clinton a democratic presidential candidate from new york said saturday that she would try to persuade musharraf to share the responsibility for safeguarding his countrys nuclear weapons with a delegation from the united states and perhaps great britain meanwhile detectives from britains scotland yard on sunday once again examined the white land cruiser that bhutto was riding in when she was assassinated pakistans staterun news agency said the associated press of pakistan said the detectives also watched videos of bhuttos last moments three times and looked at birds eye view photographs of liaqat bagh park taken from a building that overlooks the rawalpindi public site the team of five detectives arrived in pakistan friday after musharraf agreed they should work alongside pakistani agencies to determine how bhutto was killed and who was responsible for her death on saturday the team spent more than two hours at the park musharraf said he expected the scotland yard investigators to help solve all the confusion surrounding the case bhuttos husband asif ali zardari wants a united nations inquiry into his late wifes assassination the pakistan interior ministry say the former leader died when she hit her head on the lever of her cars sunroof after

in the arm to the economy president bush said friday at the white house during remarks at the white house bush flanked by economic advisers said the nations economy is at risk for a downturn and congress must act to head off trouble this growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours bush said by passing a growth package quickly we can provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy and it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments such as the housing market from adversely affecting other parts of our economy  watch more of bushs tax outline   it should equal about 1 percent of the nations gross domestic product or roughly 140 billion he added bush said the economy will continue to grow but at a slower rate the president offered no specific details of the proposed package but he did insist that it include tax incentives for business including small businesses to make major investments in their enterprises this year bush also said the economic package must include rapid income tax relief for consumers to lift our economy at a time when people otherwise might spend less although democratic leaders in congress expressed general support for bushs remarks other democrats on capitol hill met the presidents proposal with suspicion two democratic leadership aides made it clear friday that the growth package would not win support from democratic leaders unless it includes relief for low and middle income earners we want to include people who pay taxes not necessarily income taxes  a lot of lower income people pay payroll taxes said one aide another source stated flatly were not going to pass a bill in the house that doesnt include lowincome people sen charles schumer dnew york said he was disappointed that bush did not include stimulusspending measures aimed at helping the disadvantaged such as extending unemployment benefits schumer said such spending initiatives would jumpstart the economy faster than tax cuts alone i think if we avoid any of the ideological fights we could actually pass something so that it would take effect on march 1 schumer

will do the job effectively sen edward kennedy dmassachusetts agreed that we must act swiftly to boost the economy but stressed the need to help families who are struggling every day to pay their bills heat their homes and pay their mortgages bushs remarks came a day after talks on the subject with democratic and republican lawmakers and following federal reserve chairman ben bernankes call for a fiscal stimulus package to help an economy beset by plummeting stock prices and a credit and mortgage crunch bush said friday he was encouraged by his discussions with lawmakers i believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with a package that can be approved with bipartisan support existing income tax cuts supported by the bush administration are due to expire in 2010 and the president called on congress to make them permanent unless congress acts the american people will face massive tax increases in less than three years bush said this tax increase would put jobs and

will enter a recession but he said he expects growth to proceed at a slow pace this year and possibly into early 2009 he said congress needs to take decisive action to boost the economy to be useful a fiscal stimulus package should be implemented quickly and structured so that its effects on aggregate spending are felt as much as possible within the next 12 months or so bernanke said but he said

dfd0cea6589cb8be40538b9f165781fbc2c7d796,pella iowa cnn  a senior aide to republican presidential candidate mike huckabee admitted friday that the former arkansas governor had no foreign policy credentials after his comments reacting to the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto raised questions during an event friday in pella iowa huckabee said the crisis sparked by bhuttos death should lead to a crackdown on illegal immigrants from pakistan the huckabee official told cnn that when he said that huckabee was trying to turn attention away from scrutiny of his foreign policy knowledge huckabees foreign policy credentials have been under a microscope since the candidate admitted that he was unaware of an intelligence report that iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program earlier this month in light of what happened in pakistan yesterday its interesting that there are more pakistanis who have illegally crossed the border than of any other nationality except for those immediately south of our border huckabee said friday americans might look halfway around the world and say how does that affect me  we need to understand that violence and terror is significant when it happens in pakistan and its more significant if it can happen in our own cities and it happens if people can slip across our border and we have no control over them the immigration issue is not so much about people coming to pick lettuce or make beds its about people who could come with a shoulderfired missile and could do serious damage and harm to us huckabee said and thats what we need to be worried about the huckabee official said he told huckabee that his reaction to the crisis in pakistan will be the story for the next several days and until he is briefed and up to speed on pakistan a good place for huckabee to draw the line is on illegal immigration  watch a report about the surprising tactic   why does rudy giuliani get more credentials on homeland security than you do youve been a governor the huckabee campaign official said he told the candidate the campaign official admitted that huckabees tough immigration talk is also aimed at helping him win male gop voters in iowa  a bloc the official concedes the campaign has been losing ground with huckabee said 660 pakistanis entered the country illegally last year when asked by a reporter the source for that statistic huckabee appeared unsure saying those are numbers that i got today from a briefing and i believe they are cia and immigration numbers the huckabee campaign later said the figure came from a march 2006 report by the denver post but the border patrol told cnn on friday that it apprehended only a handful of illegal immigrants from pakistan in 2007 the number of illegal immigrants from pakistan deported or apprehended is not mentioned in the latest report from the department of homeland securityoffice of immigration statistics in 2005 the nation did not make the list of the top 10 sources of illegal immigrants the previous year pakistan was the last country listed but no specific numbers were given huckabee is the gop frontrunner in iowa according to most polls a

was plus or minus 7 percentage points as the campaigns enter the final stretch before the iowa caucuses on january 3 romney has gone on the attack against huckabee particularly focusing on his record on illegal immigration issues while he was arkansas governor huckabees friday comments on immigration came after he appeared to make another gaffe thursday when he seemed to suggest incorrectly that pakistan was under martial law  watch huckabees response to bhuttos assassination   while commenting on bhuttos death during an orlando florida press conference huckabee told reporters that the united states first priority should be to find the responsible parties but the most urgent thing to do is to offer our sincere sympathies and concerns to the family and to the people of pakistan and thats the first thing we would be doing other than again trying to ascertain whos behind it and what impact does it have on whether or not theres going to be martial law continued in pakistan suspension of the constitution huckabee said those are concerns that the united states certainly should have later thursday at an event in west des moines iowa huckabee told cnn that it was not that i was unaware it was suspended two weeks ago lifted the point was would it be reinstated would it be placed back in all of the aspects of martial law have not been completely lifted even now theres still a heavy hand musharraf has used conservative critics immediately pointed out that pakistani president pervez musharraf lifted the countrys state of martial law roughly two weeks ago the slip ought to be really bad news for huckabee said the national reviews jim geraghty writing on the magazines web site im not sure how big assassinationrelated news will play in the first primary states still i think those misstatements will exacerbate the hucknot huck divide in gop circles the national review has endorsed romney but cnn senior political analyst bill schneider said the debate over whether huckabee has command of the nuances of the pakistan crisis would have little impact on his support mike huckabee is a populist his comments on pakistan reflect a populist understanding of the crisis which is

dbceded6ea7d8a0944ab3f44263f688f644a5c37,kansas city missouri cnn  president bush drew parallels between the aftermath of the vietnam war and the potential costs of pulling out of iraq in a speech wednesday president bush draws parallels wednesday between the cost of pulling out of iraq and the tragedy of vietnam three decades later there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the vietnam war and how we left bush told members of the veterans of foreign wars at their convention in kansas city missouri whatever your position in that debate one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of americas withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like boat people reeducation camps and killing fields  the president said the white house billed the speech as it did next weeks address to the american legion as an effort to provide broader context for the debate over the upcoming iraq progress report by gen david petraeus the top us military commander and ryan crocker the us ambassador in baghdad bush also sought to shore up the perception of his support for iraqi prime minister nuri almaliki after voicing some frustration with him on tuesday prime minister malikis a good guy  good man with a difficult job and i support him bush said and its not up to the politicians in washington dc to say whether he will remain in his position  watch bush reiterate his support for almaliki   sen edward kennedy dmassachusetts said bush had drawn the wrong lesson from history  america lost the war in vietnam because our troops were trapped in a distant country we did not understand supporting a government that lacked sufficient legitimacy with its people kennedy said in a statement sen joe biden democratic chairman of the senate foreign relations committee invoked his own vietnam analogy in a statement released after the speech  its the presidents policies that are pushing us toward another saigon moment  with helicopters fleeing the roof of our embassy  which he says he wants to avoid biden said bush continues to cling to the premise that iraqis will rally behind a strong central government but he believes that will not happen theres no trust within the iraqi government no trust of the government by the iraqi people no capacity of that government to deliver security or services and no prospect that it will build that trust or capacity any time soon bidens statement said but house republican leader john boehner of ohio said more democrats are bucking their party leaders in acknowledging progress in iraq many rankandfile democrats have seen this progress firsthand and are now acknowledging the successes of a strategy theyve repeatedly opposed boehner said in a statement but democratic leaders deeply invested in losing the war would rather move the goalposts and claim that a precipitous withdrawal is the right approach despite the overwhelming evidence of significant progress former presidential adviser david gergen said bush ran the risk of doing as much harm as good for his case by invoking vietnam he raised the question if you learned so much from history how did you ever get us involved in another quagmire  gergen said gergen said he did agree with bush in one respect though hes right initially when we pulled back in vietnam there were massive killings on tuesday bush had expressed frustration with the pace of progress toward political reconciliation in iraq saying if the iraqi government doesnt respond to the demands of the people they will replace the government iraqi prime minister nuri almaliki on wednesday shot back at criticism of his government including pointed remarks from a us senator who called his administration nonfunctioning and urged iraqs parliament to turn it out of office speaking at a press conference in the syrian capital of damascus almaliki characterized such comments as irresponsible and said they overstep the bounds of diplomatic and political courtesy government spokesman ali dabbagh told cnn that almaliki was referring to comments made monday by sen carl levin the michigan democrat who chairs the senate armed services committee who called on iraqs parliament to turn almalikis nonfunctioning government out of office when it returns in two weeks levin said almalikis government was too beholden to religious and sectarian leaders to reach a political settlement that would end the countrys sectarian and insurgent violence in his speech bush said withdrawing from vietnam emboldened todays terrorists by compromising us credibility citing a quote from al qaeda leader osama bin laden that the american people would rise against the iraq war the same way they rose against the war in vietnam here at home some can argue our withdrawal from vietnam carried no price to american credibility but the terrorists see things differently bush said president bush has frequently asked lawmakers  and the american people  to withhold judgment on his troop surge in iraq until the report comes out in september it is being closely watched on capitol hill particularly by republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war earlier this month defense secretary robert gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160000 us troops in iraq might begin bushs speeches wednesday and next week are the latest attempts by the white house to try to reframe the debate over iraq as public support for the war continues to sag a recent cnnopinion research corporation poll found that almost twothirds of americans  64 percent  now oppose the iraq war and 72 percent say the petraeus report will have no effect on their opinion the poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report 53 percent said they do not trust petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in iraq in addition to his analogy to vietnam bush referred to previous conflicts in asia in talking about the war against terror in iraq there are many differences between the wars we fought in the far east and the war on terror we are fighting today bush said but one important similarity is that at their core they are all ideological struggles the militarists of japan and the communists in korea and vietnam were driven by a merciless vision for the proper ordering of humanity they killed americans because we stood in the way of their attempt to force this ideology on others bush said history proved skeptics wrong about japans ability to become a free society and will prove those who want to withdraw from iraq wrong in the aftermath of japans surrender many thought it naive to help the japanese transform themselves into a democracy then as now the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom bush said today in defiance of the critics japan  stands as one of the worlds great free societies email to a friend ,"new kennedy bush

simulator   a split second later another gunman emerges and ergas blasts him too think of it as wii on steroids these are things you cannot get on a range ergas says there are 50 different scenarios the simulator can create with a technician able to change each scenario a trainee can use a shotgun rifle glock 22 or glock 23 the guns shoot a laser and each shot is traced sometimes the simulator jams the guns to see how one responds to the situation after each training session the person is debriefed about why he or she opened fire or didnt fire at all each shot is analyzed because in the real world a law enforcement officer is held accountable for every bullet that comes out of his or her gun it helps investigators train for situations they could face on any given day at any given moment ergas says no one wants to shoot anyone ergas says even officers that may not have pulled the trigger will be affected by shooting and killing someone odonnell says the fact the task force rarely engages fire with suspects and that they have such rigorous training underscores you can teach tactics this is a model he says booker says it helps having a coordinated team of armed officers

eight years ago while working on the patriot he became a star while we were sequestered away in a small town in south carolina based on the strength of the dailies going back to los angeles heath was a fantastically kind and sweet young man he surrounded himself with his friends from australia and never forgot any of us he ever worked with i last saw him in australia when he called my name on a melbourne street and introduced me to michelle his then pregnant girlfriend i have great memories of going for runs with him or watching a bootleg copy of a parker and stones musical called cannibal the musical of the donner party tragedy heath must have been in a place of great pain and sadness to be split from his wife and child he was sensitive and unfairly victimized in his native country by the unfortunate australian custom called the tall poppy syndrome in which an australian the second he or she achieves global success is immediately and arbitrarily accused of losing all of their humanity not true he was a sweet person and less importantly an unbelievably talented actor maybe the best of his generation dan bova of larchmont new york  once when i was driving in brooklyn i got a flat tire as i was jacking up my car this deep voice from behind me said need a hand it was heath ledger i couldnt believe it he helped jack up my car and change the tire he was really good with tools r of perth western australia  i grew up with heath around the speedway racing circuit i remember the night he was a little boy and his dad was racing speed cars at claremont speedway my dad was in the race too his dad was coming 3rd then in the final corner the two lead cars spun out and heaths dad kim took the lead and won the state title race heath was standing a couple of rows in front of me with his mum and sister and they were all so excited jumping up and down and cheering he was about as happy as a little boy could be watching his dad become a champion i remember that night because in the years that followed i saw his parents marriage break up and it was like there was this moment in his childhood of pure joy that i witnessed later heath would pit crew for graham jones and i crewed for my dad and brother heath and i were both the youngest on our crews so that meant our job was to take the fiberglass bonnets over to the hoses and wash the mud off after each race really dirty work but he managed to stay cleaner than the rest of us crystal davis of toronto ontario  i met heath in la at a mall a year or so ago i was staring at him working up the nerve to ask for an autograph he saw me started laughing and walked towards me he said i was white as an egg and asked if he could do anything i said no thanks  yes i forgot to ask for the autograph he touched my shoulder and told me to take it easy and walked away he looked back several times and smiled what a great memory i have of him my prayers go out to his family and friends dena michnowich of glen cove new york  i was walking in the lower east side of manhattan one day and i noticed a really cute man holding his little daughter on his shoulders she looked just like him he told her that they had to make a right and asked her to point them in the right direction which she did i soon realized that it was heath ledger and i got really excited i was walking right up to them as they were waiting to cross the street when i got close i waved and he smiled at me he was so handsome i got the chills i could also sense that he had a very sweet spirit it was a very special moment for me im so sad to hear that he died leanne scorzoni of staten island new york  i worked as a nanny for a number of years in manhattan and i ended up having a toddler class with my charge and heath michelle and baby matilda the couple was so polite and laid back at first i didnt recognize who they were they were genuinely interested in their child her development and treating the rest of us including staff with respect he will be sorely missed michael williams of perth western australia  i met heath ledger many years ago while i was working at a local fast food outlet here in perth western australia he came through to order and i was amazed at how polite kind and friendly he was he stopped to sign autographs while he waited knowing that to the people asking him he was somewhat of a hero he did all this with the great australian attitude that he had and a smile on his face he was one superstar that took stardom well and in his stride i for one feel thankful that i have met this great person i send my deepest sympathy to his family and say to them that you do not mourn his passing alone the people of perth share your grief tracy kimball of rock hill south carolina  i met heath ledger in 1999 while he was filming the patriot in south carolina i was a reporter for a daily newspaper there and he was at a press conference about the movie at historic brattonsville a revolutionaryera plantation he was so very kind and was more than happy to sign my newspaper the media was flocking around mel gibson but seeing a new young and dashingly gorgeous guy standing off to himself i approached him and asked for his autograph he flashed that smile grabbed my pen and used my back to sign the newspaper i was holding we had a conversation but i dont remember it because i was so enamored i had never heard of him before because the only american movie he had filmed was ten things i hate about you which i had not yet seen i went back to the paper where i worked and wrote a story about the new hot aussie star that would surely become hugely successful in america his death really saddens me he was such a talented actor and a new dad having a child the same age as his daughter it makes me even sadder to think of her missing her father amanda olmstead of penticton british columbia  i met heath when he was filming brokeback mountain in my hometown of fort macleod he was a down to earth man with amazing talent his portrayal of ennis del mar was lifechanging for many of my friends i am truly saddened by his death kristy oconnor of sydney australia  my heart goes out to heaths family and little matilda i met heath one time at a prenatal yoga class in sydney with michelle and was in awe of his devotion and attention to her he was a true gentleman and im sure an amazing father to make assumptions as to how or why he died is to bring more pain to an already devastated family adrian k of perth western australia  i met heath one night on the town in perth the onedegree of separation rule in perth made him a friend of a friend we had a brief and quiet chat what struck me was his calm in the face of his monstrous burgeoning celebrity with both of his feet planted firmly on the ground he seemed to be facing the publicity with stoic resolve goodnight heath you were a good bloke a sad fan in chicago illinois  i was an extra in the movie dark knight which filmed in chicago this past summer i spend an entire weekend on set with heath he was rather quiet most of the time between takes but seemed to be a nice likeable guy it was great to watch him work as he was very committed to his craft his death is a great loss kelly fishburne of west palm beach florida  i met heath ledger while working in atlanta we both were taking a cnn tour he was silly smiling all the time and we spoke about horses and riding lessons he was also talking about the movie the patriot he filmed with mel gibson he had to do lots of riding he was down to earth and so very talkative just a normal guy hanging out a real gentleman jessi lee of central south carolina  i really enjoyed heaths acting his best movie was my favorite movie of 2005 lords of dogtown heath played the somewhat obnoxious skip engblom but thinking of all the other actors who could have taken the roll i dont think anyone could have done it better even two of the original zephyr shop boys themselves tony alva  stacy peralta said when

one of his attorneys leah perry who sent this photo of son bobby and dog rosie thinks vick should not be allowed back on the field the plea deal may include prison time but the nfl has not yet decided what football sanctions if any it should impose on vick a spokesman said we asked cnncom readers whether they thought vick would  or should  play professional football again as well as their opinions on the case  below is a selection of those responses some of which have been edited for length and clarity stephanie king of arlington washington michael vick is a disgrace for anyone thinking he should be let off easy for admitting his guilt  think again the only reason he did that was because he knew the evidence against him was so great remember only shortly ago he was stating vehemently that he only owned the property and had no idea what was going on there it wasnt until the eyewitness accounts were brought to light that he apologized one cannot be sorry for torturing and killing animals as you know its been proven that those with the ability to do so also have a stronger chance of being abusive to humans how can we allow someone like that to be a role model for children if we do were degrading our society and shame on us patricia reese of paola kansas yes i think mr vick should be allowed to play football again he is a talented individual and it would be a shame to waste that talent i also believe he should be able to rebuild his life however as part of his restitution to society i believe he should contribute at least 40 of his salary for what could have potentially been his maximum jail sentence to the humane society to help abused and abandoned animals debbie clayton of greensboro north carolina he should never be allowed to play in the nfl or earn a dime associated with the nfl he should be made to work so many hours per week every week at minimum wage at an animal shelter jeff wise of atlanta georgia why not give him a chance to play again seriously how many chances has the nfl given to ricky williams smoking pot is against the law but hes been given a number of chances and still isnt banned from the nfl jeremy montgomery of mount laurel new jersey i think that vick should not be allowed to step on the field again and any endorsement deals revoked what he did was reprehensible he is in a spotlight where he should be held at a higher standard for a role model josh hebert of loganville georgia he should take whatever punishment our government gives him but when he has done his time if he does do time he should be able to continue playing football the charges against him are not football related in any way angela ziegler of cleveland ohio the nfl needs to step up to the plate and be the man that michael vick is not allowing him in their league gives a signal that animal abuse is ok with them remember jeffrey dahmer started as an animal abuser want him as your role model or a spokesman kelly koch of holland michigan the nfl and all sponsors should refrain from any future contact with michael vick i for one will boycott those with future dealings with him john robinson of redmond washington pro athletes are constantly getting in trouble with the law unless we make a policy that all players who are convicted of a felony are banned from the league then vick should be allowed to play after a suspension randy jonson of stamford connecticut until i know the depth of the gambling angle its hard to be certain dog fighting is brutal but if its only dog fightingkilling he should get whatever the feds give him and be able to return to football once his debt is paid bill saray of derby connecticut vick should never play again he wasnt the best qb to begin with anyone with such a blatant disregard for life  animal or human  is not worthy of the position in life he was given playing in the nfl is not a right as such the league should ban him permanently while society should shun him publicly if only scarlet letters were still around todd morrison of howell michigan mr vick should be judged of his crime not by his fame nor his race he should be prosecuted as a person i believe mr vicks nfl playing days should be determined by the nfl commissioner with consideration of the nfls personal conduct policy this is how everyone should be treated in america everyone is equal regardless of popularity fame and race lance g of dearborn heights michigan first off i am an africanamerican  this is not a race issue i wish the ignorant people here in the us would get off that tip this is not an issue to raise the race card even his socalled homies who were all black turned on him vick  committed a felony and now he has to pay for it he should have chosen a better hobby in life than dog fighting as for playing football  he should be banned from the league for at least 2 to 3 years including his jail time leah perry of chelmsford massachusetts i dont think vick should be allowed to play football nor should he get off easy after he serves his sentence i think he should work at the mspca to make him see what cruelty to animals really looks like in all aspects steven todd of fort wayne indiana i think michael vick will play football again though at what level is anybodys guess i do not think he should be banned for life he may have gambled but not on the game as pete rose did a suspension is in order and i think a year would be fair but a prison term and suspension would put him out of football for up to three years and who knows what kind of qb he will be after this ordeal and so long an absence jennifer runyan of fayetteville north carolina i think the whole michael vick case is disgusting the nfl needs to ban him permanently he shouldnt be able to use the obscene amount of money he makes to torture innocent animals kids looked up to him and how many of them will think that abuse is ok now i dont think he deserves to play ever again i applaud the people sending michael vick jerseys into the atlanta humane society to use cleaning the kennels now thats appropriate watch what a dog thinks of his vick jersey  debbie connor of whitesville kentucky no he should not be granted

percent of the amazon rainforest has been wiped out the wealth of biodiversity is so immense we cannot even estimate the amount we dont know says cludio c maretti brazilbased director for conservation for the world wildlife fund every new expedition you do to the amazon you might find one new species of fish every other you might find some new bird or frog the amazon rainforest which encompasses an area nearly as large as the continental united states and stretches across nine countries is considered the worlds richest and most varied natural habitat with several million species of insects plants birds and fish calling it home it also plays an important role in regulating earths temperature as its dense vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into the air but the amazon has been under pressure from outside forces for decades in the past 40 years roughly 20 percent of the rainforest has been wiped out maretti says an additional 17 percent has been degraded to varying degrees we have been deforesting at enormous rates maretti says the chief drivers of this deforestation are largescale business interests involved in logging mining agriculture and especially cattle ranching some of this activity is sanctioned by the government much of it is not greenpeace estimates as much as 80 percent of the logging is illegal the amazon rainforest is just one of many habitats around the world threatened by encroaching development or natural resource extraction the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations estimates that 50000 square miles of forest  more than three times the size of switzerland  are lost each year because of clearing and degradation the threat is particularly acute in the more tropical areas of south america africa and southeast asia

percent of its primary forests over the same period the worst rate of forest loss in the world according to fao the destruction of the earths oldest and richest forests is not a new phenomenon but the rate of destruction has increased in recent decades worldwide onehalf of all forests weve lost in the last 10000 years has occurred in the last 80 years half of that was destroyed in the last 30 years says scott paul forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace paul says the chief driver of forest destruction is the buying and selling of forest products and farm products in the international market not to meet local needs the timber market and also for agriculture mining when it plugs into the international economic system thats when youve got to watch it he says paul would like to see a certification system so that consumers know the source and conditions under which the product theyre consuming was harvested if you buy wine and cheese we can tell the region and the year but forest products have always been cut in remote and distant areas and thrown in a pipe and spit out on the other side there is no way to determine if something came from a wellmanaged forest or an illegal forest where there is slavery murder drug trade etc he says while the story of the worlds oldgrowth forests would appear to be one of unremitting destruction forests lost to logging and agriculture are actually growing back in some areas such as the northeast region of the united states and parts of europe this thrills some wildlife advocates who would like to see the restoration of exiled or decimated species northern new england is the only place in the eastern united states where you have the potential for largescale wilderness where wolves lynxes cougars woodland caribou and salmon rivers could be restored according to michael j kellett executive director of restore the north woods we could literally have almost the entire ecosystem of the maine woods as it once was with largescale agriculture all but gone from new england and logging companies concentrating their attention elsewhere kelletts biggest fear is that real estate development could begin to carve up the vast forests of maine his proposed solution create a national park in brazil in recent years the government reportedly has stepped up efforts to slow the amazons destruction last october brazil said the rate of deforestation plunged 41 percent because of the enforcement of environmental laws environmental groups say the drop also was caused by the fall of soy prices and the rise of brazils currency against the dollar making the countrys exports more expensive the world wildlife funds maretti is hopeful that brazil with international help will be able to protect even more of the amazon

94a9883a283e94c3ad53069d98517b08e8853447,cnn  not only is sheikha lubna al qasimi the first woman to hold a ministerial post in the united arab emirates the first female minister of economy in the gulf and the first to start a middle eastern bb marketplace but shes also the first minister  anywhere in the world  to launch her own perfume line member of sharjah royal family and one of forbes 100 most powerful women sheikha lubna took the post of minister for economy and planning of united arab emirates in 2004 her background is in it and before the government appointment worked at the dubai ports authority where she gained the distinguished government employee award in 1999 for developing a documentation system that reduced cargo turnaround from one hour to ten minutes in 2000 sheikha lubna founded tejari the first middle eastern businesstobusiness marketplace as a result of tejari arabic for commerce 70 percent of dubais government purchases are made online while only 30 percent of bureaucrats were webliterate before its launch one of the cornerstones of sheikha lubnas work has been to allow for foreign ownership so when john defterios met up with her he began by asking her about her upcoming strategy sheikha lubna we are looking with scrutiny at the companies a lot at the moment and we have several sectors we will evaluate each sector from the service side finance accounting and any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth then we will focus on that on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company defterios if you look at the middle east specifically within this gulf region its quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership is this society in the region ready for this move sheikha lubna interestingly the united arab emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside we host 200 nationalities so for us the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community so in many ways i think the openness is only a natural path its an organic path to continue the openness that exists foreign direct investment is not your own wealth when you have your own wealth you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes because its your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure however if you look at foreign direct investment it mandates you to be much more transparent you have to be very diligent about your work and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment defterios its interesting you read the front line of the dp world po acquisition and the furor it created in the united states particularly within congress what are the lessons not just from the uae perspective but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process sheikha lubna first of all i think it is important to understand in this global world there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad weve learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad and weve seen this where the uae invests in the far east australia asia as well as in europe and the united states whats more important to understand is that if youre going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that i dont want to sell to this particular organization versus another there are other places defterios thats not a veiled message your saying thats pretty forthright this comment sheikha lubna but its a message to all of us if today i lock up my investment opportunity here money will not come to me money will go somewhere else when i have investment coming from abroad it creates confidence in this country that i am a global image so when i say it i am not directing this as a message to a particular country i am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation when it comes to responsibility when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country so thats really a lesson thats very very critical defterios a number of firsts the first to start a b2b marketplace the first female minister within the country an economy minister and the first to launch a perfume range as well what is it all about trailblazing setting examples being an entrepreneur how would you describe what youre doing here sheikha lubna everybody laughs about the perfume one i think the united arab emirates since inception its not from today but from the founder late sheikh zayed has always given equal opportunities for women but its up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push and what it is that we can do and not do in my personal belief you need a bridge you need a door opener for women and sometimes women do not want to take the risk sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving i had the opportunity and i had the trust from the government and the community so to me it is setting the example internally for the young women and men by the way be it in technology or economy or ecommerce defterios and the perfume line is the exclamation point sheikha lubna a young woman actually a perfume creator who sells exclusively to saks fifth avenue in dubai decided to create a perfume with my name so i had two mandates from her one i had to smell it otherwise if it doesnt smell good im not going to take it as a name so one i had to actually agree to the scent of the perfume and its an arabic perfume by the way and second my mandate was that i would only launch it with my name for her if she gives 20 percent of its sales and revenue to the friends of cancer

him under surveillance twice this year sources familiar with the investigation said wednesday sources say new york gov eliot spitzer used a callgirl service eight times in recent months spitzer announced his resignation wednesday two days after reports of his connection to the emperors club vip became public he has not been charged with a crime he told reporters wednesday i cannot allow my private failings to disrupt the peoples work the resignation will take effect monday  watch spitzer say he will resign   the sources said the investigation began when new yorks north fork bank notified the treasury department about suspicious transfers of money from spitzers bank accounts that investigation led agents to the alleged organizers of the prostitution ring four of whom were charged in a criminal complaint last week the sources said a grand jury in new york is likely to hear evidence in the case soon said kathleen mullin an attorney who said she represents one of the rings employees mullin would not identify her client but said she was not the woman identified only as kristen linked to spitzer in court papers she said her client and other women who worked for the emperors club have been asked to testify before the grand jury asked if her client had any encounters with spitzer mullin said we have no information regarding the governor wiretaps on suspected members of the ring authorized in january yielded more than 5000 telephone calls and text messages and another 6000plus emails according to court papers in those intercepts the organizers told clients how to arrange and pay for their trysts a federal agents affidavit states the affidavit identified clients by number with spitzer designated client 9 a source with knowledge of the investigation told cnn this week sources familiar with the investigation said federal authorities wednesday were trying to clamp down on leaks of the investigations details  see a timeline of the investigation   the affidavit states client 9 paid 4300 for 2 hours with a call girl he arranged to meet at washingtons mayflower hotel with some of that a deposit on a future session court papers state he also paid for train tickets cab fare minibar and room service charges for kristen  a 5foot5 105pound brunette he arranged to meet the night of february 13 kristen is a 22yearold wouldbe singer from new jersey the new york times reported wednesday the newspaper said ashley youmans  now known as ashley alexandra dupre  was identified in court documents as kristen dupre has not been charged with a crime she made a brief appearance monday in us magistrate court as a witness against four people charged with operating the emperors club the times said in an entry on her myspace page dupre says she left a broken family and abuse in 2004 eventually settling in manhattan to pursue my music career i am all about my music and my music is all about me she writes on her myspace page it flows from what ive been through what ive seen and how i feel dupres mother carolyn capalbo told the times she and her daughter were close adding that she obviously got involved in something much larger than her spitzer whose squeakyclean image as a corporate corruptionbuster made him a rising democratic star testified to the house financial services committee the next day about the effect of the mortgage meltdown he took a state plane from buffalo new york to washington and back to new york his office confirmed tuesday sources told cnn that fbi agents had spitzer under surveillance at the mayflower that night  and on an earlier occasion on january 26 when no prostitute showed up his resignation is unlikely to affect decisions about whether he will face prosecution the sources said his attorneys were negotiating wednesday with the us attorneys office in new york in an effort to avoid criminal charges a source told cnn but in a statement issued after the governors resignation us attorney michael garcia said no agreement had been reached between his office and the governor relating to his resignation or any other matter the resignation could be a factor in the us presidential race spitzer was a superdelegate one of nearly 800 party leaders and officials who cast their votes at the democratic national convention they are free to vote for any candidate they wish spitzer was a political ally of new york sen hillary clinton who is currently in a tight race with illinois sen barack obama to win the democratic nomination a candidate must get 2024 delegates to clinch the democratic nomination with the race so close superdelegates could play a larger role in determining the democratic presidential candidate than in past elections according to two sources who spoke tuesday with cnn spitzer hit the federal radar when a bank reported to the internal revenue service that a significant amount of money had been suspiciously transferred from one account to another late last year upon investigating the movement of money that the bank initially reported the irs found that the accounts were connected to spitzer the sources said the irs contacted the fbi which joined the case to investigate the possibility of government corruption federal law requires a banking institution to file a suspicious activity report when the institution suspects a transaction is linked to a federal crime more specifically banks are required to report to the irs any transactions totaling 5000 or more if the transactions involve potential money laundering or a violation of the bank secrecy act the act requires businesses to keep documents that are useful for identifying and investigating money laundering after receiving the irs report last year the fbi corruption squad linked the account transfers to a prostitution ring according to sources the fbi criminal division joined the probe to look into the prostitution ring while the federal corruption team continued its investigation into spitzer legal experts not involved in the case have said spitzer could face some type of moneylaundering charge such as structuring a financial transaction to evade federal bank reporting requirements by breaking up a large transaction into smaller ones sources tell cnn that prosecutors have considered pursuing a structuring charge but have run into some difficulty and richard smith a former justice department official said structuring charges are fairly difficult to prove you are going to have to prove that he withdrew sums of money with the intent to evade the reporting requirements to conceal the fact that he is withdrawing the money said smith the former deputy chief of the justice departments fraud section because if the money was withdrawn it appears if his lawyers are correct in a manner that he didnt conceal anything it begs the question whether or not they can prove the reckless intent that he withdrew this money in small sums to avoid the reporting requirement spitzer also could face charges related to the mann act which makes it a federal offense to transport someone across state lines for the purpose of prostitution but sources tell cnn that the government is less interested in pursuing charges for prostitution than on following the money email to a friend  cnns kevin bohn contributed to this report,"kristen identified as aspiring singer ashley youmans 22

another and not been able to get across that these are lives that literally were blown apart no matter how hard we in the media try iraq remains a nation filled with untold tragedies the scope of

laurean hadnt been taken into custody after lauterbach reported the alleged rape was told there were indications that lauterbach and laurean carried on some sort of friendly relationship after she filed the complaint against him the information developed over the last 24 hours leads us to believe that she still had some kind of contact with him said paul ciccarelli agent in charge of the naval

last weeks iowa caucuses sen hillary clinton has spent the past few days saying she has the experience to change washington she narrowly defeated sen barack obama in the new hampshire primary with 39 percent of the vote to obamas 37 last week i listened to you and in the process i found my own voice the new york senator said after her victory now lets give america the kind of comeback that new hampshire has just given me fortythree percent of selfstyled independents said they voted for obama and 31 percent said they backed clinton independents made up 43 percent of all voters polled addressing his roaring supporters after the race was called obama congratulated clinton but he was a candidate determined to draw a distinction between clinton and himself but the reason our campaign has always been different the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago is because its not just about what i will do as president he said it is also about what you the people who love this country the citizens of the united states of america can do to change it thats what this election is all about but clinton was ahead of obama 45 percent to 34 percent among those who said they were registered democrats those voters made up a majority  54 percent  of all respondents clinton also claimed the majority of womens votes according to the polling thats in contrast to last weeks iowa caucuses in which obama surprised observers by stealing the female vote from clinton analysts say that shift among female voters was crucial to the clinton turnaround if i had a single word the word would be women  said cnn political analyst bill schneider she got the women back and schneider said the support of union voters that put clinton over the top union voters have her a 10 point lead he said cnn projected former sen john edwards to finish third college graduates who made up 29 percent of the electorate opted narrowly for clinton  38 percent to obamas 37 percent according to the polling those polled who called themselves very liberal and moderate went with clinton over obama  although by less than 2 percentage points in each  and those who said they are somewhat liberal were evenly split pundits also were citing the role of former president bill clinton in helping his wife recover from what preprimary polls were suggesting was a deficit of 9 percentage points to obama in new hampshire the former president spent tuesday in hanover  home to dartmouth college  where obama had been expected to win handily they dispatched him to the area that obama was surging said cnn analyst donna brazille who managed former vice president al gores campaign in 2000 i think it had the effect of tamping down obama support and giving senator clinton a real reason to come back in this race new hampshire was considered crucial to clintons campaign if obama had been able to sweep iowa and new hampshire  after months of clinton being considered the frontrunner among democrats  it could have given him powerful momentum going into future primaries age is also playing a big factor  older voters are overwhelmingly outnumbering younger voters  a proportion that is clearly benefiting clinton schneider said sixtyseven percent of democratic primary voters are over the age of 40 and they are breaking heavily for clinton over obama over the past several days clinton has trumpeted her experience saying that she has delivered change as both first lady and as a senator after losing to obama in last weeks iowa caucuses it was unclear whether she could overcome what appeared to be obamas ability to electrify american voters who had previously taken a sour and skeptical view of politicians and the political process the duel between the obama and clinton campaigns grew especially testy monday and tuesday she said she had more experience than he and was therefore more qualified he accused her of representing the status quo of washington and on the eve of the new hampshire primary bill clinton criticized the media for not pressing obama more fully on iraq and accused the illinois senator of shifting his position to reflect changing attitudes about the war in iraq then there was an issue unto itself  hillary clintons almosttears clintons eyes welled up this week while responding to a voters question about her health and appearance pundits and voters alike questioned whether clintons emotions were sincere or faked as part of some strategy to diminish criticism that she is too steely too cold in front of the crowd of mostly female new hampshire voters an admittedly fatigued clinton responded to a question by saying this is very personal for me its not just political its that i see whats happening we have to reverse it her voice broke and she was then applauded by the crowd polls indicated the show of emotions fared well with male voters according to cnns john king but turned off some female voters edwards was followed in votes by new mexico gov

pilfered art lands in  respectable places and it was an uncommon ending for stolen art  someone found it recovering masterpieces happens in less than 5 percent of cases said bonnie magnessgardiner the fbis art theft program manager usually expensive pieces go missing no one knows who took them no one gets prosecuted and everyone wonders why steal something you cant turn to cash quickly art thieves do a simple risk versus reward evaluation said corine wegener associate curator of the minneapolis institute of arts thieves know that even if they receive only a fraction of the works market value the cash gained was at low risk of death or injury  museums can be a relatively soft target said wegener whos teaching a university of minnesota class this month on art theft but it could be years  or never  before the thief sees even a small payoff in 1990 robbers took 300 million worth of certified masterpieces  among them rembrandts storm on the sea of galilee and vermeers the concert  from the isabella stewart gardner museum in boston massachusetts no ones seen them since on sunday robbers made off with one of the biggest art hauls in european history grabbing four paintings worth an estimated 163 million from the eg buehrle collection in zurich switzerland they took works by paul cezanne edgar degas claude monet and vincent van gogh  see what robbers grabbed in switzerland   these paintings are extremely valuable on the open market but theyll never go onto the open market so at the same time theyre both priceless and worthless said charles hill the former chief of scotland yards art and antiques unit some thieves may buy into the myth that a wealthy but unscrupulous collector will contact them and offer to take the art off their hands wegener said when this doesnt happen the thieves often try to ransom the art back to the museum or the insurance company one london art dealer who said he has handled stolen works told cnn on condition of anonymity that an insurance company would rather get art back at a fraction of its original price than pay the owner its insured value  watch how art thieves operate   ransoming art to an insurance company through an intermediary adds up to 10 percent of the market value which  given the art market is quite a lot of money the dealer said david vuillaume secretary general of the swiss museums association told time magazine that ransom may be what the thieves behind the swiss heist want we are thinking that maybe in a week or two there will be a ransom demand but we just have to wait and see time quoted him as saying the museum has offered 90000 reward for information leading to their recovery time reported options for art thieves  julian radcliffe chairman of the art loss register which operates a database to help recover lost and stolen art said ransom or reward are unlikely to bring results it is very seldom that people have been able to undertake a ransom he said this gang might think that a reward has been offered and that theyll get the reward but in fact the reward wont be paid unless someone is arrested or there is proper criminal intelligence and thats unlikely to happen radcliffe said he said the thieves may just be patient willing to get their payoff decades later or the art may move through an underground network gradually increasing in value before being slipped back onto the legitimate market take spielberg he bought schoolroom in an abovetheboard transaction usually these pictures will change hands in the criminal underworld at a fraction  1 percent or less  of their true market value radcliffe said before someone tries to get them back into the international market in such an effort the seller may hope the work has been forgotten over time or they may disguise it as a copy or student recreation they may try and sell them not as being by degas but as being a copy or school or by a follower of one of the great artists and that is the ways in which they try and get them on the market radcliffe said the original thieves rarely face justice the fbis magnessgardiner said the stolen items turn up years sometimes decades after the theft she said because a work of art does not require a title document in order to be transferred from one owner to another a stolen object easily enters the legitimate stream of commerce it is impossible to trace them back to the original thief in most cases even if the original thief can be identified there is also a statute of limitations on prosecution for theft magnessgardiner said what happens to stolen art even if the art is recovered original owners may not get it back while museum pieces are likely to go back to their collections private owners may not be so lucky russian schoolroom remains in spielbergs possession while courts determine the rightful owner a spokesman for the director said but art stolen from a los angeles mansion and sold in sweden remains with its swedish purchasers according to a case file posted on the web site of the los angeles police departments art theft detail even though the thief was caught the swedish government refused to return the paintings claiming that according to swedish law the auction buyers had purchased the paintings in good faith according to the web site in the case of rockwells russian schoolroom someone took it from a gallery in clayton missouri a st louis suburb in 1973 according to an fbi synopsis of the case in 2004 the fbis art crime team found out that the piece had been for sale at a new york rockwell exhibition 15 years earlier and posted a picture and description of the painting on its art recovery web site spielbergs staff learned of the search and told the fbi that spielberg had it in his collection in los angeles he had purchased it from a legitimate dealer in 1989 an fbi press release said the agency also determined the painting was auctioned in new orleans in 1988 but it has yet to determine who took the painting or its whereabouts from 1973 to 1988 whoever took russian schoolroom from the suburban st louis gallery in 1973 or the masterpieces from the boston museum 1980 or the works lifted in zurich this week

of his brain was damaged half of his left arm was amputated and some of the fingers were blown off his right hand ziegel a 25yearold marine sergeant knew the dangers of war when he was deployed for his second tour in iraq but he didnt expect a new battle when he returned home as a wounded warrior a fight with the department of veterans affairs sometimes you get lost in the system he told cnn i

anticipated receiving a monthly va disability check sufficient to cover his smalltown lifestyle in washington illinois instead he got a check for far less than expected after pressing for answers

driving he lost his right arm the va initially rejected his claim saying his severe shrapnel wounds were not service connected  watch anderson describe my arm was hanging there   who would want to tell an iraqi or afghanistan soldier who was blown up by an ied that his wounds were not caused by his service over there said andersons wife sam after pressure from sen dick durbin of illinois the va acted on andersons case he has since been awarded compensation for a traumatic brain injury it upsets me that the va system operates in a way that it takes people of power  and who you know and what you know  to get what you want said anderson who is now retired when asked about andersons case specifically the vas mansfield said such cases make him more dedicated to fixing the system in july

anchor thanks for checking out our latest summer edition of cnn student news where todays show all about tech im carl azuz a college professor has found a way for his students to listen to his lectures even when theyre not in the classroom and we talk to students and experts to find out some of the ways technology is being used in schools first up gadget gifts  azuz its better to give than to receive youve probably heard it a hundred times but when that gift is for a techie theres a gaggle of gadgets to go through so how do you know which present to pick reynolds wolf is here to help with the breakdown on some cool tech toys begin video clip reynolds wolf cnn reporter are you searching for that perfect gift but you are just a little bit stumped well no worries brian cooley from cnetcom is here to help us out steer us clear and hopefully give us some great ideas and i know you have some great ideas for us brian cooley editoratlarge cnetcom look at these beauties first of all for gaming you know the nintendo wii is hot but you cant find one the nintendo ds light is a pretty good placeholder the dual screen that its known for theyve slimmed it down from its original ds and of course that great legacy of all those great nintendo games and pretty cheep for 130 or less you can get one of these thats very affordable check out this music player reynolds its gonna be the next kind of ipod its from sandisk its called the sansa connect that little bump is a wifi antenna this can connect wirelessly to the internet or to other devices like it to share music download music and stream internet radio that is really the future of ipodlike devices if you want to give a phone but you also want to give a music player this one does both nokias 5300 music express is a great music player its not an ipod but its not bad transport controls and volume buttons out here tell you that its something different and then for a camera i like this very flat sony t100 its pocketsize which is very hot these days nice slidedown door 8 mega pixels image stabilization and a great big screen for sharing photos wolf brian cooley of cnetcom thank you so much cooley you bet end video clip shoutout  george ramsay cnn student news time for the shoutout when did the first ipod debut if you think you know it shout it out was it a 1997 b 1999 c 2001 or d 2003 youve got three seconds  go if you guessed c youve got the right tune the popular portable players first made the scene in the fall of 2001 thats your answer and thats your shoutout tech in the classroom  azuz whether its an ipod sony samsung or zune it seems like you cant go anywhere these days without seeing people plugged in to some type of mp3 player and if youre on a college campus you might think students walking around with their ear buds in are listening to music but dont be fooled they could just be studying up for class begin video clip azuz walk around any college campus and those famous white earplugs seem to be everywhere but sometimes the playlist isnt quite what youd expect lectures on computer science instead of american idol not so much sum 41 as history 101 some teachers have used the audio ipod in their lessons but at the georgia institute of technology professor jim foley hopes to transfer his visual web lectures to the video ipod professor foley user interface design teacher the students who did web lectures earned grades that were about 10 better  we did that three years ago azuz as mp3 players become essential parts of students lives they have the potential to rival the laptop as learning tools in the classroom with a graduate students help foley records lectures before class so that students can raise questions when they arrive students from foleys user interface design course say they find it valuable to review lectures when convenient kathy pham student in professor foleys user interface design class it takes 15 minutes to walk from one side of campus to the other side of campus and to be able just to download the mp3 to my ipod and just walk across campus would be very beneficial scott gilliland student in professor foleys user interface design class a lot of people cant get to a full desktop computer whenever they need to listen to the lectures and its nice to be able to take them with you azuz although students show enthusiasm towards mp3 players there are limitations because theyre small foley the screen resolution is smaller and navigating between pages will be a little bit slower than on the computer because on the computer i just use the mouse with the ipod i have to use the scrollwheel and scroll around azuz like the laptop the mp3 player is a popular and revolutionary way to gather and disseminate information regardless of what teachers decide to use players and laptops will remain allies besides you need a laptop to operate an ipod and vice versa end video clip podcast promo  azuz and if downloading lectures isnt enough weve got another cool thing you can do with an mp3 player watch cnn student news thats right you can download our podcast at cnnstudentnewscom or at itunes so you wont miss out on the news when youre on the go now and then  ramsay with cell phones thin is in but you had to flex some muscle to handle its oversized ancestor an ipod can hold your whole music library but a vintage walkman let you jam out one cassette at a time microchips keep getting smaller and smaller but old school computers took up a lot more space and game controllers have buttons for every possible move but the retro version one button one joystick tons of fun learning with technology  azuz its not just slimmer cell phones and smaller computers advances in technology are changing the world we live in all the time and one of the places where those changes are taking place is schools so we talked to some students and experts to hear what they have to say about teaching with tech begin video clip trina davis president international society for technology in education we started off when we were first starting to integrate technology kind of at that basic level matthew lewis junior greenside high school we of course use laptops and computers each teacher is assigned a laptop and also we have computer labs and a media center with computers inside don knezek ceo international society for technology in education certainly just dropping technology into a learning environment doesnt necessarily improve it unless you are sure that the activities that you are doing align with the expectations that you have for learning ammarah mahmoud junior salem high school i think many careers today require for people to know how to use technology so its important to learn that in school  knezek so you cant convince me that a student without basic fundamental technology skills is on equal footing for employment mahmoud i dont think schooling should be technology dependent because i think that at the same time we shouldnt rely on something that doesnt have a mind of its own knezek you can certainly abuse technology you can abuse the printed word you can abuse access to external resources certainly if teachers and school leaders and parents use the same standards that they would use for any resource for technologies then were in fine shape lewis i can see people in the future having something where you just scan and all of your you know personal information comes up and everything about you can come up on a screen and i think thats really cool davis customization very innovative lots of gaming lots of 3dimensional spaces and just social spaces that feed on the needs of young learners end video clip goodbye  azuz and that is the last word in this special edition of cnn student news well see you back

8180a77657661e975e3fac6c7fdbd8de97fd160e,aol autos  okay youve decided what model of car you want to buy and you know more or less how much you want to spend  or how much you can afford youve kicked tires talked to salesmen taken a few shiny new numbers for a testdrive and youre ready to make the deal if you eat in your car you may want to consider fabric or leather protections except youre not quite done you still need to decide whether to buy any of those extras that your salesperson will always suggest some of these extras have real value and are probably worth adding others  maybe not so much the list of extras offered by most dealers may include paint sealant fabric protectionleather care extended warranties extended one price service contracts rustunderbody coatings and antitheft systems to mention a few we wanted to know which of these new car extras were worth it and which ones a consumer can do without to get to the bottom of it we thought we would consult an expert  david bennett manager of automotive programs for aaa as it turns out like most things in life the answer often just comes down to whats best for you depending on your own situation budget or locale lets address these addons one by one  paint sealant  i think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days so in most cases you probably dont need that anymore said bennett who offered one caveat but that can depend on what part of the country you live in  what the climate is whether you get a lot of snow and ice and what the road crews put down on the road  whether it is salt or if it is something that is less harmful to the paint but generally as long as you keep your car washed and wash that salt off of it and get it waxed regularly that paint should last without getting the addon sealer at the dealership also if you get a chip or a ding get it fixed so the rust doesnt get a chance to set in and spread fabric  leather protection  these extras are fairly selfexplanatory  the dealer treats the upholstered or leather seating with a protection product that make the seats more resistant to stains or scuff marks this can be a good purchase but the first question you should ask before buying it is what kind of lifestyle do i lead suggests bennett do you have a lot of kids and are they prone to spill things or is your vehicle mostly going to be occupied by adults do you eat in the car with some regularity if so and youre just too darn messy for your own good a stain protection might be a good way to go also look at exclusions in the plan advises bennett if youre a smoker and the plan excludes burn holes from cigarette ashes and youre not diligent about making sure your ash is always short that might not be a good purchase because of that exclusion each of these policies or plans is probably offering something different and you need to read all of the exclusions before making that purchase because it might not be a good one for you if you want to save some cash one option would be to forego the protectant and just make sure you clean your seats regularly with a good upholstery cleaner or leather cleaner to remove spots from a leather seat use a good leather cleaner and work it into the spot with a soft cloth if the spot still remains let it sit for a few hours repeat as they say if necessary its also a good idea  to use a leather conditioner regularly on leather seats to restore moisture and to maintain its appearance rustproofing  this is when the dealership applies various rustinhibiting chemicals waxes or sealers to the vehicles undercarriage it can also be applied to other rustprone areas rustproofing treatments sometimes include a guarantee over a certain number of years keep in mind that some guarantees require annual checkups to reapply the sealers or rust inhibitors to any areas where the rustproofing may have been damaged i dont think this is necessary in most cases opines bennett the way most vehicles are constructed today they are not nearly as prone to underbody rusting as they used to be in the old days  even in the north where they get a lot of snow lojack car security system  antitheft systems  the folks at lojack car security systems report that a vehicle is stolen every 25 seconds in the us using a car alarm is one way to protect your vehicle but if you want to go the more hightech tracking route using a security system like lojack may give you more peace of mind the lojack system includes a small radio frequency transceiver hidden in up to 20 different places in the vehicle the system uses a code that is tied into the vehicle identification number vin then when you report that your car has been stolen the state police crime computer can match code against the state vin database this automatically activates the lojack system in the vehicle  emitting an inaudible signal then police cruisers and aviation units that have the lojack tracking system can identify the vehicles location track it and recover it lojack claims that over 200000 vehicles have been recovered worldwide using their system with over 100000 of those in the us whether or not this is a purchase you should make depends on various factors if you live in a highcrime area a system like this could provide you with peace of mind advises bennett but even if you live in a safe lowcrime district your car can still be stolen from a busy downtown street or parking garage he notes one caveat some car owners may not want their car back after it has been stolen especially if it has been seriously vandalized or if it has been driven so hard that it causes some mechanical problems another thing to consider is that owners of gm vehicles that come with its patented onstar system probably wont need a theft tracking program says bennett because the system allows onstar operators to track the location of the vehicle if it is stolen so if you buy a gm car with the onstar system you may want to pass on a lojack or similar tracking system extended warranties  this really does depend on how long you plan to keep the vehicle because most of these extended warranty plans dont kick in until the manufacturers warranty expires advises bennett and these days those manufacturers warranties are three or five years sometimes longer so if you plan on selling the car after three or five years it probably doesnt make sense to buy the extended warranty some warranties offer transferable policies which let you sell the warranty along with the vehicle others allow you to return the warranty for a prorated refund bennett also explains that not all warranties are created equal they usually have three levels of warranties a basic extended warranty will just cover the powertrain for example while a better one will cover the powertrain plus some other components that are listed  or an exclusionary extended warranty may say it covers everything except those items that are listed at the top end the best warranty just covers everything but that is also the most expensive bennett gives an example of one manufacturers warranty for a 2007 buick the basic manufacturers warranty is five years or 100000 miles for the powertrain coverage and the corrosion warranty is six years or 100000 miles in fact thats the same warranty gm offers on their chevy and cadillac brands thats a pretty good warranty so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less the extended warranty is probably money you dont need to spend email to a friend ,"gm owners wont need lojack because cars come with onstar option 
smokers considering fabric protection should check for policy exclusions 
but generally as long as you keep your car washed you dont need sealant

fdb54e157f8f4e5a479dbc6288587e52fffde33f,cairo egypt cnn  omar bin laden has a message for his father osama find another way omar bin laden says he last saw his father in 2000 when the son decided to leave al qaeda the son of the mostwanted man in the world spoke sunday to cnn in a quiet middleclass suburb about an hour outside cairo egypt omar bin laden who works as a contractor said he is talking publicly because he wants an end to the violence his father has inspired  violence that has killed innocent civilians in a spate of attacks around the world including those of september 11 2001 i try and say to my father try to find another way to help or find your goal this bomb this weapons its not good to use it for anybody  he said in english learned in recent months from his british wife he said thats not just his own message but one that a friend of his fathers and other muslims have expressed to him they too say  my father should change his way he said  watch whether omar bin laden thinks his father will ever be caught   he said he hasnt spoken to his father since 2000 when he walked away from an al qaeda training camp in afghanistan with his fathers blessings he said he has no idea where his father is but is confident he will never be caught because locals support him asked if his father might be living along the afghanpakistan border he said maybe maybe not either way the people there are different he said they dont care about the government now he and his wife are preparing to launch a movement far different from the one his father osama bin laden launched they are pursuing a movement for peace at first glance omar bin laden appears to have little in common with the man who has eluded international efforts to find him the 26yearolds hair is bound in neat braids he drives a jeep and is married to a british national twice his age but the physical resemblance quickly sinks in even without the long beard his father favors it is a resemblance he doesnt avoid being osamas son i dont hide it i dont hide my name he said i am proud by my name but if you have a name like mine you will find people run away from you are afraid of you he said he doesnt consider his father to be a terrorist when his father was fighting the soviets washington considered him a hero he said before they call it war now they call it terrorism he said he said his father believes his duty is to protect muslims from attack he believes this is his job  to help the people he said i dont think my father is a terrorist because history tells you hes not however omar bin laden  who was 14 when he began training in al qaeda camps  said he differs greatly with his father over the killing of civilians was 911 a just attack i dont think 911 was right personally but it happened he said i dont think  the war in vietnam was right i dont think whats going on in palestine is right i dont think whats going on in iraq is right if we make what is right and not right we will make a very big list he said he said he left al qaeda because he did not want to be associated with killing civilians he said his father did not try to dissuade him from leaving al qaeda i told him i was going and wanted to try life and see what it was like outside because from a young age i was with my father and i only saw and heard my father and his friends my father told me if this is what your choice  your decision  is what can i tell you i like you to be with me but this is your decision  so father and son went their separate ways but there has been no running from the bin laden name not after the events of september 11 on that day omar bin laden was in saudi arabia where 15 of the 19 hijackers were from asked if upon learning of the news he knew his father had been behind it he replied yeah maybe he said he felt sadness for those killed i dont think 911 was right personally he said i dont agree with 911 or with any war where only civilians are dying asked why he did not protest more strongly his fathers role in the killing of civilians he said it is up to the religious clerics close to his father to tell osama bin laden to change tactics in the name of islam and even if that most unlikely scenario were to occur he said al qaeda would not stop my father doesnt have the power to stop the movement at this moment sitting by his side throughout the hourandahalf interview was his wife zaina the two are organizing a multimonth horserace through north africa in the name of peace set to kick off this year but getting sponsors to line up behind the name bin laden has been difficult it would probably have been easier to do a race without having omars name but then the race would just be a race it wouldnt be a race for peace his wife said omar bin laden said his relationship with his father was limited he is the fourth of 11 children born to his fathers first wife and he is one of 19 children osama bin laden has fathered most of the time he busy so busy all the day hes busy with his friends he was working a lot omar bin laden is now undertaking perhaps an impossible task trying to rebrand the name they share but he said he is not looking for approval from his father my life i take care of my life he said my father he take care of his life email to a friend ,"bin ladens son omar says his father should change his ways

in the midwest or northwest odds are that you dont miami ranks as the worst city for most aggressive drivers for the second straight year in a nationwide study of driver habits followed by new york boston los angeles and washington but if road rage is a cultural phenomenon as one of our experts suggests how best do we go about combating driver frustration across the nation traffic black spots  the nations roads are peppered with traffic black spots junctions where car snarls elicit road rage in even the most mildmannered drivers southern california has the san diego i405 freeway and the nations busiest junction where us 101 meets it to the north of los angeles miami and the east coast have i95 which snakes from the worlds busiest cruise port up to maine the district of columbia and the beltway are infamous for gridlock ive spent three very nervous hours getting to chicagos ohare airport from the city center before missing my flight traffic by definition is worst in major metropolitan areas  if your farming community is gridlocked youd better be grousing at your local council meetings  but it is the increase in traffic that leads many to suggest its just going to get worse traffic levels are rising seemingly as fast as home foreclosures in los angeles and miami in these areas its not only the rise in number of drivers but the rising age of drivers aaa points out that seniors are the fastest growing demographic in the us that suggests drivers should adjust their habits accordingly aaa has launched its lifelong safe mobility campaign to help seniors adjust to more crowded roads and perhaps more aggressive drivers the facts and remedy  when the aaa foundation for traffic safety studied more than 10000 incidents of road rage and violent aggressive driving committed in the 1990s it found that at least 218 people were killed and another 12610 injured when drivers got angry many of these aggressors are males aged 18 to 26 the aaa web site offers a threestep plan to avoid becoming the victim of aggressive driving   the first tip is dont offend which includes cutting off other drivers driving slowly in the left lane tailgating and gesturing to other drivers  the agency then warns to not engage which advises steering clear of trouble not making eye contact and getting help by calling 911 in the event of experiencing dangerous aggressive driving it then asks atrisk drivers to adjust their attitude which involves forgetting winning for the drivers to whom driving is a darwinian survival of the fittest or putting themselves in the other drivers shoes  finally they recommend that if you think you have a road rage problem seek professional help other peoples actions  so the wife and i were looking for sofas it was a sunday morning and with me behind the wheel we were dawdling around quiet streets trying to find one of those seemingly ubiquitous furniture warehouses soon the wife pointed one out but we were almost past it i hit the brakes and quickly pulled in then realized that a mercedes mclass had pulled in right behind me a large squat tattooed guy jumped out and started shouting about 10 feet from my car i have children in the car i had to slam on the brakes how dare you brake so quickly he said getting real mean i appreciated id probably braked quickly and that it was bad driving on my part however as his tirade continued i very calmly asked why he was setting such a bad example for his young children by following another driver off the road then shouting and swearing the man continued his harangue before climbing back into his vehicle and driving away the next time youre fulminating in your front seat about anothers aggressive driving remember that your driving will almost inevitably elicit the same response in someone else and dont swear in front of your kids or set a bad example for them cultural phenomenon dr leon james is a professor of psychology at the university of hawaii and web master of drdrivingorg he is also the coauthor of road rage and aggressive driving with this wife diane nahl james began studying driving psychology about 20 years ago after his wife told him her mother thought he took turns too fast over a period of selfstudy he said he was amazed by the mistakes he made and the aggressive thoughts he experienced toward other drivers he recorded them via his speakaloud method using his method on students he discovered that road rage is a cultural phenomenon we call the back seat of the car the road rage nursery where young children pick up all the drivers bad habits james said its a cultural temper tantrum james said local norms can play a part for example florida drivers yell at each other more than in california where verbal interplay can be interpreted as road rage in a criminal court but in the main its drivers trying to deal with their emotions in stressful situations james said that in his studies an awareness gap exists in aggressive drivers when asked about drivers habits respondents suggested that about 85 percent of other drivers drove aggressively while just 35 percent said they themselves drove aggressively if you feel your blood boiling frequently behind the wheel classes like james are sprouting all over the nation addressing road rage  in an ideal world an increase in drivers would automatically be met by an improvement in infrastructure and fewer roadrageinducing distractions another utopian ideal is for everyone else to drive more considerately one look at our nations crumbling roads tells us that this fantasyland

school richard sonnen spent 16 months in mental health institutions after plotting to kill his high school classmates it would be a fitting payback to his high school classmates who richard said relentlessly bullied him i always wanted to get back at them richard sonnen said of his classmates i always wanted to strangle them  i was always mad i was always angry and i would come home and cry to mom and dad both richard and elaine sonnen spoke to cnn at the 45acre family farm unlike  columbine and recent school shootings at northern illinois university and virginia tech elaine sonnen did see the warning signs in her son and was able to stop him elaine and her husband tom adopted richard from a bulgarian orphanage when he was just 4 years old i mean we just loved him and he was just a big sparkle of life she said but only a few months after they brought him home they began to see another side of their son he was angry and unpredictable elaine sonnen says that at age 6 richard told her he wanted to kill her she said he would shake with anger to the point that hed scream at her telling her he wanted to destroy her people thought he was just the greatest kid in the world very polite wellmannered caring elaine sonnen remembered at home he could be anywhere from just a really helpful kid to a monster a terrifying monster  mother says son had two personalities   in junior high he said evil classmates started picking on him boys and girls he said bullied him until he couldnt take it anymore i always wanted to get revenge he said by the eighth grade richard was put on antipsychotic medications he had been diagnosed as bipolar and was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and other disorders in 1999 when the columbine shootings happened the sonnens feared that richard might do the same thing one day we stopped and looked at each other and said this could be richard some day this could be him  elaine sonnen said years later during his junior year in high school they were right fed up with the bullies richard says he felt like an outcast and started looking for a way to get even secretly he began reading books about columbine in his school library the shooters eric harris and dylan klebold became his heroes they planned it out so perfectly and so meticulously  that i just wow you know he said theyre my gods  watch a preview of campus rage   he even created a hit list of the classmates he planned to kill at prairie high school in cottonwood idaho my plan was to set around bombs around the school  i analyzed a lot of where everybody sat and where everybody did their thing he said i had pinpoints of where i wanted to go where i wanted to do it harvard medical school psychologist william pollack who consulted on a 2002 federal government study of school shootings said it found that most school shooters often had feelings of anger sadness and isolation as well as homicidal and suicidal thoughts we see a young man who obviously is telling us how depressed he was how angry he was and how much he looked up to people who we know are very disturbed and very dangerous and how close he came to killing people said pollack who watched cnns interview with richard elaine sonnen found out about her sons plan during a conversation with him she ordered him to write down the names of the eight students he wanted dead and then gave the list to his caseworker the next day later he added a teacher and his mother and sister to the hit list she took immediate action and had her son committed to an idaho mental institution over the next 16 months he received treatment at several mental health facilities throughout idaho there i opened up i felt better i moved on with myself richard said they felt at that point  they had done everything they could do for him elaine sonnen added he was doing great he could make it on his own they had no question in january 2007 after almost a year and a half in mental institutions richard sonnen started a new life at lewisclark state college in lewiston idaho he was taking a cocktail of three antipsychotic drugs to help him function for the first time in 12 years i was able to hold my son said elaine sonnen so i knew he was on the road to be well everything seemed to be looking up but in april 2007 three days after the virginia tech massacre richards mother received a call from police they told her richard had made about four threats to carry out shootings at lewis clark state college and lewiston high school police told her richard planned to go home get some guns and go back to school to pull off a sniper attack from a clock tower on the colleges campus she said police took him into protective custody and searched his apartment for clues but in the end he was released because authorities say they didnt have enough evidence to charge him with a crime richard said the whole incident was a big misunderstanding he said he was telling people about his high school plot and never threatened his college or local high school but his mother doesnt believe his version of the story no i believe he made those threats she said i still believe it richard now 19 signed an order banning him from campus for one year today he lives on his own in washington state hes still on medication but not seeing a psychiatrist since hes over the age of 18 his mom cant force him to go is elaine sonnen still afraid of her son yeah at times im very afraid she said because he still has a lot of anger towards me she said the signs are still there and she fears what could happen if he ever stops taking his medicine hes not getting the help and the insight from a professional that could see the signs she said because as a person with a mental illness you have skewed

ab3c9bac8bcfef89da719c4aba8ea4eee71e4daf,ip455 press release 8 february 2008   the findings of a scotland yard inquiry into how mohtarma benazir bhutto died after being attacked during a political rally in rawalpindi were presented to the government of pakistan today the bomb explodes near bhuttos vehicle following a political rally in rawalpindi the conclusions of the inquiry were outlined in a detailed report handed over to interim interior minister hamid nawaz by detective superintendent john macbrayne accompanied by a senior official from the british high commission during a meeting in islamabad the text of the executive summary of the report is as follows  on the 27th december 2007 mohtarma benazir bhutto the leader of the pakistan peoples party ppp died as a result of being attacked in rawalpindi pakistan following discussions between the prime minister and president musharraf it was agreed that officers from the metropolitan police counter terrorism command so15 should support the investigation into ms bhuttos death the primary focus of the scotland yard team was to assist the pakistani authorities in establishing the cause and circumstances of ms bhuttos death the wider investigation to establish culpability has remained entirely a matter for the pakistani authorities the so15 team was led by a detective superintendent senior investigating officer and comprised two forensic experts an expert in analysing and assessing video media and an experienced investigating officer the team arrived in pakistan on 4th january 2008 and spent two and a half weeks conducting extensive enquiries during the course of their work the team were joined by other specialists from the united kingdom the uk team were given extensive support and cooperation by the pakistani authorities ms bhuttos family and senior officials from ms bhuttos party the task of establishing exactly what happened was complicated by the lack of an extended and detailed search of the crime scene the absence of an autopsy and the absence of recognised body recovery and victim identification processes nevertheless the evidence that is available is sufficient for reliable conclusions to be drawn within the overall objective a particular focus has been placed on establishing the actual cause of death and whether there were one or more attackers in the immediate vicinity of ms bhutto the cause of death  considerable reliance has been placed upon the xrays taken at rawalpindi general hospital following ms bhuttos death given their importance the xrays have been independently verified as being of ms bhutto by comparison with her dental xrays additionally a valuable insight was gained from the accounts given by the medical staff involved in her treatment and from those members of ms bhuttos family who washed her body before burial ms bhuttos only apparent injury was a major trauma to the right side of the head the uk experts all exclude this injury being an entry or exit wound as a result of gunshot the only xray records taken after her death were of ms bhuttos head however the possibility of a bullet wound to her mid or lower trunk can reasonably be excluded this is based upon the protection afforded by the armoured vehicle in which she was travelling at the time of the attack and the accounts of her family and hospital staff who examined her the limited xray material the absence of a full post mortem examination and ct scan have meant that the uk home office pathologist dr nathaniel cary who has been consulted in this case is unable categorically to exclude the possibility of there being a gunshot wound to the upper trunk or neck however when his findings are put alongside the accounts of those who had close contact with ms bhuttos body the available evidence suggests that there was no gunshot injury importantly dr cary excludes the possibility of a bullet to the neck or upper trunk as being a relevant factor in the actual cause of death when set against the nature and extent of her head injury in his report dr cary states   the only tenable cause for the rapidly fatal head injury in this case is that it occurred as the result of impact due to the effects of the bombblast  in my opinion mohtarma benazir bhutto died as a result of a severe head injury sustained as a consequence of the bombblast and due to head impact somewhere in the escape hatch of the vehicle given the severity of the injury to ms bhuttos head the prospect that she inadvertently hit her head whilst ducking down into the vehicle can be excluded as a reasonable possibility high explosives of the type typically used in this sort of device detonate at a velocity between 6000 and 9000 metres per second this means that when considering the explosive quantities and distances involved such an explosion would generate significantly more force than would be necessary to provoke the consequences as occurred in this case it is also important to comment upon the construction of the vehicle it was fitted with b6 grade armour and designed to withstand gunfire and bombblast it is an unfortunate and misleading aspect of this case that the roof escape hatch has frequently been referred to as a sunroof it is not it is designed and intended to be used solely as a means of escape it has a solid lip with a depth of 9cm ms bhuttos injury is entirely consistent with her head impacting upon the lip of the escape hatch detailed analysis of the media footage provides supporting evidence ms bhuttos head did not completely disappear from view until 06 seconds before the blast she can be seen moving forward and to the right as she ducked down into the vehicle whilst her exact head position at the time of the detonation can never be ascertained the overwhelming conclusion must be that she did not succeed in getting her head entirely below the lip of the escape hatch when the explosion occurred how many people were involved in the immediate attack there has been speculation that two individuals were directly involved in the attack the suggestion has been that one suspect fired shots and a second detonated the bomb all the available evidence points toward the person who fired shots and the person who detonated the explosives being one and the same person  body parts from only one individual remain unidentified expert opinion provides strong evidence that they originate from the suicide bomber  analysis of the media footage places the gunman at the rear of the vehicle and looking down immediately before the explosion the footage does not show the presence of any other potential bomber   this footage when considered alongside the findings of the forensic explosive expert that the bombing suspect was within 1 to 2 metres of the vehicle towards it rear and with no person or other obstruction between him and the vehicle strongly suggests that the bomber and gunman were at the same position it is virtually inconceivable that anyone who was where the gunman can clearly be seen on the media footage could have survived the blast and escaped the inevitable conclusion is that there was one attacker in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle in which ms bhutto was travelling in essence all the evidence indicates that one suspect has fired the shots before detonating an improvised explosive device at the time of the attack this person was standing close to the rear of ms bhuttos vehicle the blast caused a violent collision between her head and the escape hatch area of the vehicle causing a severe and fatal head injury john macbrayne qpm detective superintendent counter terrorism command 1st february 2008 email to a friend ,"scotland yard releases report into assassination of benazir bhutto

the grim milestone of 4000 deaths troops emerge from a bunker after receiving the all clear sunday following a truck bombing in mosul the four were killed when their vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device while patrolling a neighborhood in southern baghdad the us military headquarters in iraq reported sunday night a fifth soldier was wounded in the attack which took place about 10 pm 3 pm et the us milestone comes just days after americans marked the fifth anniversary of the start of the war no casualty is more or less significant than another each soldier marine airman and sailor is equally precious and their loss equally tragic rear admiral gregory smith the us militarys chief spokesman in iraq said every single loss of a soldier sailor airman or marine is keenly felt by military commanders families and friends both in theatre and at home smith said of the 4000 us military personnel killed in the war 3263 have been killed in attacks and fighting and 737 in nonhostile incidents such as traffic accidents and suicides eight of the 4000 killed were civilians working for the pentagon many of those killed over the years like the four soldiers slain on sunday in baghdad have been targeted by improvised explosive devices  the roadside bombs that have been described as the weapon of choice for insurgents and a weapon that has come to symbolize iraqs tenacious insurgency the existence of the pentagons joint improvised explosive device defeat organization has been developed to counter the threat of ieds in iraq as well as afghanistan the group calls ieds the weapon of choice for adaptive and resilient networks of insurgents and terrorists  watch how ieds have become deadly staple in iraq war   meanwhile estimates of the iraqi death toll range from about 80000 to the hundreds of thousands with another 2 million forced to leave the country and 25 million people displaced within iraq according to the un high commissioner for refugees president bush ordered us troops into iraq on march 19 2003 after months of warnings that theniraqi leader saddam hussein was concealing stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and efforts to build a nuclear bomb un weapons inspectors found no sign of banned weapons before the invasion and the cia later concluded that iraq had dismantled its weapons programs in the 1990s husseins government fell in early april 2003 and iraqs new government executed him in december 2006 the news of the 4000 mark came on the same day that iraqs national security adviser urged americans to be patient with the progress of the war contending that it is well worth fighting because it has implications about global terror this is global terrorism hitting everywhere and they have chosen iraq to be a battlefield and we have to take them on mowaffak alrubaie said sunday on cnns late edition with wolf blitzer if we dont prevail if we dont succeed in this war then we are doomed forever he said i understand and sympathize with the mothers with the widows with the children who have lost their beloved ones in this country but honestly it is well worth fighting and well worth investing the money and the treasure and the sweat and the tears in iraq nearly 160000 us troops remain in iraq and the war has cost us taxpayers about 600 billion according to the house budget committee the conflict is now widely unpopular among americans a cnnopinion research corp poll out wednesday found only 32 percent of americans support the conflict and 61 percent said they want the next president to remove most us troops within a few months of taking office in the weekly democratic radio address saturday sen bob menendez of new jersey said president bush took us to war on the wings of a lie menendez said that the war has depleted the resources and morale of the us military diverted national attention away from the war in afghanistan where al qaeda is regrouping and hurt the hunt for osama bin laden the iraq war has not made americans safer menendez said but has instead hurt the us economy the senator called for a responsible new direction regarding iraq cnn learned last week from several us military officials familiar with the recommendations but not authorized to speak on the record that senior us military officials are preparing to recommend to bush a four to sixweek pause in additional troop withdrawals from iraq after the last of the surge brigades leaves in july if the conditions on the ground dictate that we have to have a pause then we will have to have a pause alrubaie said the return of all five brigades added to the iraq contingent last year could reduce troop levels by up to 30000 but still leave approximately 130000 or more troops in iraq alrubaie emphasized sunday that any drawdown of us troops has to be based on the conditions on the ground it depends on the development and the growth and the equipment and the capabilities of the iraqi security forces and the preparedness of the iraqi security forces he said this should not be a purely political decision it should be also a technical military and intelligence decision but there has been too much footdragging on key governance questions in iraq democratic sen ron wyden of oregon said on cnn on sunday it seems to me you put off those troop withdrawals you send exactly the wrong message to the iraqis on wednesday bush will visit the pentagon to be briefed by the joint chiefs of staff chaired by adm michael mullen the american troop level in iraq depends on the negotiations that we are engaged in now between the government of iraq and the united states government alrubaie said when conditions warrant the withdrawal of american troops the iraqis will say thank you very much indeed  alrubaie said a big big thank you for the united states of america for liberating iraq for helping us in sustaining the security gains in iraq  and we will give them a very very good farewell party then responding to recent remarks from us presidential candidates that iraqis are not taking responsibility for their own future alrubaie said iraqis are making political and security gains literally by the day and by the week we are gradually assuming more responsibility he said noting that iraqis have taken responsibility for security in many provinces other developments   us troops raided a suspected suicide bomber cell

delegates needed for the nomination the democrats superdelegate system is supposed to avoid turmoil at the partys conventions sens hillary clinton and barack obama are running neck and neck toward the partys august convention in denver colorado most projections show neither getting the necessary 2025 delegates in the remaining nominating contests before then party rules call for the votes of superdelegates  800 or so party officers elected officials and activists  to tip the balance the party instituted the system to avoid the turmoil that a deadlocked race would create at a convention but even some superdelegates are questioning the system as the party heads toward the conclusion of a race in which they might determine the outcome its not the most democratic way of doing things said maine superdelegate sam spencer  watch the scenario for a civil war in the democratic party   at least two organizations have launched petition drives to reflect how the vote went in primaries and caucuses moveonorg which has endorsed obama is trying to get 200000 signatures this week and plans to run an ad with its petition in usa today and democracy for america headed by democratic national committee chairman howard deans brother jim said it will deliver signed petitions to all the superdelegates while pledged delegates are allocated with the understanding theyll vote the way their state went in its primary or caucus superdelegates are free to vote however they want and even if they pledge their support to a candidate theyre free to change at any time clinton already has 234 superdelegates and obama has 157 but obama has a sizable lead in pledged delegates 1096 to 977 and is on a roll having won all eight nominating contests since super tuesday  see which states pledged delegates come from   if the superdelegates were to tip the balance against the popular vote the turmoil would last long beyond the convention longtime democratic party strategist tad devine said if a perception develops that somehow this decision has been made not by voters participating in primaries or caucuses but by politicians in some mythical backroom i think that the public could react strongly against that devine said the problem is if people perceive that voters have not made the decision  instead insiders have made the decision  then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process particularly the young people who are voting for the first time will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated he said superdelegates were established in 1982 to bring more moderate democrats back to conventions where their attendance had been dropping since the 1950s and to relect the partys mainstream more accurately superdelegates are the keepers of the faith said former san francisco california mayor willie brown you have superdelegates because this is the democratic party you dont want the bleedover from the green party the independents and others in deciding who your nominee will be devine was part of the first campaign to benefit from the roles of superdelegates  that of former vice president walter mondale in 1984 mondales 1984 campaign went into the party convention with too few delegates to secure the nomination against the campaigns of former sen gary hart and jesse jackson mondale had received more votes but hart had won more states mondale was able to line up the superdelegates going into the convention and avoid a fight on the convention floor each campaign actively is trying to encourage the unpledged delegates to pledge to their side jason rae a 21yearold wisconsin superdelegate said hes gotten calls from former president clinton and former secretary of state madeleine albright from hillary clintons camp and obamas wife michelle visited with him during a campaign stop tuesday in wisconsin rae said he hasnt yet decided how hell vote in wisconsins primary on tuesday crystal strait a party activist from california said shes received calls from clinton herself and daughter chelsea but she remains uncommitted massachusetts superdelegate john walsh said hell stay loyal to obama despite the fact that the senator lost the primary in walshs state so will fellow massachusetts superdelegates sens edward kennedy and john kerry among clintons committed superdelegates are harold ickes jr her husbands former deputy chief of staff terry mcauliffe who led her husbands 1996 reelection campaign and is chairman of her campaign and her husband whether those superdelegates stay committed to their candidates even if it means tipping the outcome of the race against the pledged delegate lead or the popular vote could split the party its in a total contradiction of the way the democrats have set up their primary process with all this proportional representation said cnn political analyst amy holmes the whole point of it was that no one could walk away with the elites and if this is decided by superdelegates i think the democratic party morally is going to be looking at each other and say what did we just do  devine said it could hurt the party in the general election i think it will hurt us particularly because so many of the policies that were saying we will pursue in government as democrats are based on fairness whether its the tax policies that we advocate or the social programs we want to advance theres a fairness component in all of that he said people need to believe i think that our process is fair as well if they want to believe that our policies will be fair email to a friend  cnns campbell brown

as she desperately tried to potty train her daughter molly molly graduated from potty school four days before her brother archer was born it was awful teres said we tried everything including bribery and threats teres the mother of three from andover massachusetts hoped her middle child would be toilet trained by the time she was 2 two years later the girl was still in diapers refusing to use the bathroom i was going crazy teres admitted she wouldnt poop she would hold it for days at wits end teres enrolled molly in the toilet training school at childrens hospital boston by the time the children come in with their families it has become a power struggle explained dr alison schonwald a pediatrician who supervises the poop school as its affectionately called by staffers the kids kind of dig in their heels and put a line in the sand  health minute watch more on the perils of potty training   the american academy of pediatrics reports that most children show signs theyre ready to potty train between 18 and 24 months doctors suggest a child may be ready to start trying if hes staying dry for at least two hours at a time during the day walking to and from the bathroom asking for a diaper change and asking to use the potty for some kids the toilet training process can take more than a year or longer the sixweek program at childrens hospital is one of a handful around the country kimberly dunn a pediatric nurse practitioner has worked with some of the 450 young graduates over the years she said most of the kids admit they are afraid to use a toilet oftentimes the parents come in and they want to know why theyre afraid dunn said you could ask the kids until theyre blue in the face and you hardly ever find out why dunn meets with a halfdozen children once a week she uses books music and art to help the students overcome their fear of using the toilet she helps them set small realistic goals for instance she said week one involved just sitting on the toilet for five minutes she encourages positive reinforcement and simple rewards such as extra playtime with mom or dad while dunn works on the kids psychologist elaine leclair an instructor at the harvard school of medicine offers frank advice to the parents in a separate room i just say step back they hate to hear me say this but i say whatever youre doing now is not working you really need to try something different leclair said she said many parents come to the sessions angry and anxious they come in feeling extremely discouraged very isolated thinking they are the only ones in the world who have this problem teres acknowledged thats how she felt imagine my surprise to find out there were thousands of kids who had this problem after years of hiding her daughters toilet training troubles from family and friends the group parenting sessions allowed teres to open up about her frustrations it was like going to betty ford joked teres who felt she had exhausted all her other options a majority of the children who attend the childrens hospital class are dealing with constipation issues often caused by delayed toilet training teres learned that her daughter had a medical condition called encopresis experts call it a symptom of chronic constipation and say it occurs when a child resists having a bowel movement youngsters like molly are sometimes given laxatives or other medications to help encourage them to go schonwald the author of the pocket idiots guide to potty training doesnt want parents to be discouraged during the process no one goes to college in diapers right everyone will get through this time as awful as it might feel if youre struggling she suggested achieving success during potty training has to do with the approach there are three things you cannot make a child do eat sleep or poop we find that by decreasing the pressure and expectations that children feel more confident schonwald reminds parents that toilet training is not a chore so keeping it positive from the very beginning is the most important thing if a child isnt using the toilet by the age of 4 she recommends talking with a pediatrician schonwald also said setbacks during potty training are normal all developmental skills come in spurts with periods of regression after a setback schonwald advises parents to give their child positive messages that they can succeed by saying so you had some accidents today well try again tomorrow four months after graduating from poop school teres is relieved to report that molly is fully toilet trained you would never know this was an issue said teres she even used an automatic flush toilet the other day i waited to see her reaction and she was ok email to a friend  judy fortin is a correspondent with cnn medical news linda

very quickly gates said because of the complexity of this series of moves i respectfully ask the senate to move on them expeditiously hopefully by memorial day so the families and we can plan appropriately odierno was in line for a pentagon desk job as army vice chief just over a year after helping petraeus implement the surge in us troops in iraq the pentagon says petraeus will stay in iraq long enough to make the first recommendation on further troop cuts after the surge is over  watch the challenges ahead of petraeus   gates said the generals promotions reflected an endorsement of the current course in iraq the course certainly that gen petraeus has set has been a successful course so frankly i think staying that course is not a bad idea i would say its a good idea gates said  watch gates nominate petraeus   central command which oversees us forces in east africa the middle east and central asia has its headquarters at macdill air force base in tampa florida gates said odierno is well known to troops in iraq to military leadership and to iraqis and i believe in most parts of the world especially in the middle east personal relationships make a difference i believe that this arrangement will probably preserve the likelihood of continued momentum and progress gates said the defense secretary said he expects to easily win senate approval for the nominations once they are made by president bush he said he had spoken with sens carl levin dmichigan john mccain rarizona and john warner rvirginia and i dont really anticipate any problems in a press release wednesday mccain praised the move both of these great generals have served our country with skill and distinction and i am pleased that they will continue to do so in positions of high responsibility mccain wrote gates acknowledged that fallons decision to step down was unexpected i had intended that adm fallon probably stay on for a third year his second year would have ended in february he said so im faced with a critical combatant command where a commander is needed  and a commander who knows whats going on in the region asked whether he was using petraeus almost as a finger in the dike because of the shortage of army generals with expertise in counterinsurgency warfare gates admitted that there are few army officers with experience in and knowledge of iraq odierno served as commander of the 4th infantry division the unit that captured former iraqi president saddam hussein petraeus was picked in january 2007 to replace gen george casey as the chief commander in iraq and won senate confirmation that month he previously served as head of the us army combined arms center and as a commander in iraq and he was one of the main writers of an army manual on counterinsurgency efforts he was seen as the logical choice to replace fallon in his new post he will oversee us forces in all the middle east not only iraq and afghanistan i recommended him to the president because i am absolutely confident he is the best man for the job gates said in testimony to congress this month petraeus said iranian agents have played a destructive role in iraq by backing shiite militants called special groups by the united states the us believes that irans islamic revolutionary guard corps quds force is behind the support for militants unchecked the special groups pose the greatest longterm threat to the viability of a democratic iraq petraeus testified last month in an interview with cnns kyra phillips in baghdad petraeus acknowledged some friction between himself and fallon in the past year but actually over the last six months or so our relationship was really very very good there was friction in the beginning he has a different job than i have petraeus said there can be understandable differences of your take if you will on a situation as they say in politics and government 101 where you stand on an issue sometimes depends on where you sit in the organization and we sit in different chairs email to a friend  cnns jamie mcintyre contributed to this report,"gates says changes will probably preserve  momentum and progress

adcb3e7b4bef0f9efe7a838b56131ca99b587743,johannesburg south africa cnn  white students at a south african university tricked black residence hall workers into eating stew containing urine prompting a march wednesday in which five people were arrested university officials said students protest against a racist video on the campus of free state university in bloemfontein south africa the white students made a video of the incident which they staged in reaction to the universitys efforts to integrate its residences according to a statement from the university of the free state the protesters on wednesday included black and white students who later marched to the residence where the video was made and demanded that it be shut down witnesses said the video surfaced on tuesday but was made in september the university said in the video white male students at reitz residence are seen encouraging at least three black female housekeepers to participate in what the students call the reitz fear factor an apparent reference to the television show in which contestants eat live worms or compete in other feats  watch excerpts of video that sparked outrage   in one scene from the video a student mixes what looks like a beef stew in a plastic bowl and adds garlic and other items then he tells the camera he will add the special ingredient the student then urinates into the mixture which he later stirs up and puts in a microwave other students can be heard laughing on the tape the next scene shows a different student urging at least three housekeepers to drink cups full of the stew saying this is our dorms fear factor we want to see who has the best fear factor on the video the student does not tell the women that there is urine in the mixture the women on their knees spit the stew into buckets after tasting it some appeared to vomit but the women also laughed during the incident as the student urged them on next the women struggle to run in what appears to be a race the video is put in slowmotion as the theme from chariots of fire plays finally one of the students awards a large bottle of whiskey to one of the women telling her she has won the fear factor at the end of the video a message appears on the screen in afrikaans saying that at the end of the day is what we think of integration university officials and human rights groups in south africa denounced the video the executive management of the university condemns this video in the strongest possible terms as a gross violation of the human dignity of the workers involved said ufs rector frederick fourie in a statement posted on the universitys web site we have immediately started with a most urgent investigation into this matter he added later wednesday fourie met with the employees seen in the video and apologized to them a statement from the university said counseling is being provided for the workers it added the students involved in the video have been identified and will be suspended fourie said and charges against the men will be filed with the south african police service two of the students in the video are still enrolled at the university but had been barred from the campus in bloemfontein according to the university two others completed their studies last year the students seen in the video have not made any public comment since the video surfaced i am deeply saddened that students apparently see nothing wrong in producing such an offensive and degrading video i have publicly said several times that the ufs is not a place for racism the rectors statement said the fact that it is openly linked to the integration process in ufs residences is also most disturbing fourie said a spokeswoman in free state province for the democratic alliance  an opposition party which says it puts equal rights for all south africans at the center of its policies  called the video shocking and inhumane it looked like they were willing participants but they didnt know what purpose the video served  it was quite humiliating at the end to see the quite senior ladies on their knees eating the meat said spokeswoman liana van wyk the south african press association reported helen zille the democratic alliances leader wednesday asked the south african human rights commission to conduct an investigation into racial tensions at the university the abhorrent footage of students abusing university workers is a fundamental infringement on the victims constitutional right to have their dignity respected and protected zille said in a statement posted on the groups web site this incident is symptomatic of racial tensions that have been simmering at the campus for some time over the issue of hostel residence integration she said fourie acknowledged in his statement that the university is going through a difficult time with its efforts to racially integrate its residences and to create a new residence culture based on diversity respect human dignity and human rights he added these kinds of actions make it all the more important that we succeed with establishing such a new institutional culture on the campus i appeal to all staff and students to remain calm and to act in the best interests of the university the university a research center is one of south africas oldest founded in 1904 it has more than 25000 students according to its web site and uses a

9c7687a36469fc0e2203edb31f303274a611fb12,greensburg kansas cnn  there are still piles of bricks and rubble on countless streets in greensburg kansas a year after a tornado demolished more than 90 percent of the town on may 4 2007 a ferocious twister blasted greensburg kansas killing 11 people in the town of 1400 yet what is happening in the citys rebuilding process may not only reinvent greensburg but provide a model for green building everywhere just a week after the deadly tornado hit may 4 2007 a similar idea sparked in the mayor a representative from the governors office and a nonprofit expert from a nearby town the concept if the whole town had to be rebuilt anyway why not be bold and build it as a global example of conservation energy efficiency and creativity daniel wallach the nonprofit specialist soon got the green light to help residents and businesses start over in a project known as greensburg greentown kansas is known for being very conservative wallach said  watch how the town went green   my first order of business was to listen what i heard were a lot of concerns about politicization and being associated with tree huggers i helped frame it with the people here in such a way they saw this is their movement he said fifthgeneration greensburg resident anita hohl joined the staff of greensburg greentown as a web specialist i was pretty green to begin with i used to get teased about being a tree hugger now its the thing this has really brought us so much closer together what you can accomplish when just a few people are working toward the same goal is amazing she said her farming grandparents instilled the virtue of being energyefficient my grandma always put her clothes on the line did her own gardening and reused everything hohl said hohl and her husband a daughter a son four cats a dog and two birds are among the greensburg residents in femaville a cluster of mobile homes set up as temporary housing the family hopes to break ground soon for their new house and move in by thanksgiving although they have made the best of the cramped quarters she says there are some challenges it sort of feels like living in a cheap motel but its a lot better than it could be its nice to have a place to be she said from the start the greentown staff knew that getting the business community on board with the green plan was vital and in rural america there is no business thats more of a bedrock than the john deere dealership in greensburg that dealership has been in the estes family for four generations their facility was wiped out by the twister the building was a total loss and we saved only 13 pieces of machinery out of 220 on the lot kelly estes said the fema guy said he had never seen anything like it steel twisted into brick and then the miles per hour needed to pick up combines that weigh 25000 pounds and move them half a mile in the air he said kelly and his brother mike decided to rebuild in town to the highest greenbuilding standard the us green building council establishes a rating system for efficient buildings called leed or leadership in energy and environmental design the greensburg facility is aiming for leed platinum the most demanding standard there is one wind turbine on their new property a 100foot structure designed to generate 5 kilowatts of electricity it is providing power for the construction site although green may be viewed as trendy and new by some mike estes knows that it is not for show were looking at saving money here truthfully we are were running a business if we cant make this make sense why would we do it he asked and he says the nonpolitical approach of the city in encouraging energy efficiency has helped i dont think its red or blue to be green i think green is green and green makes sense and green saves you green he said with a laugh being a model for the world in energy efficiency is a major goal of greensburg greentown but there is another even more urgent aim keeping this rural town from disappearing the lack of jobs in many small towns means that after teenagers graduate from high school they have to leave to find other opportunities the average age of people living in rural communities is in their 50s wallach said there are very few folks in the communities under that age because there are just no jobs families have been split up for decades so in addition to the longterm goal of greensburgs pretornado businesses from leaving people hope to attract new green trade as well the city wants to open a biodiesel facility as one of its first green newcomers another longterm goal is to have 100 percent renewable energy it is probable that the greatest contribution would come from large wind turbines the timing of all this is in some ways almost spooky wallach said its like the world was ready for this to happen for a town to be completely reimagined the tragedy was terrible but the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity email to a friend ,"greensburg rebuilds green after tornado demolished 90 percent of the town

nevada  see what the results mean   i did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white south carolina or a black south carolina i saw south carolina he said the choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders obama said its not about rich versus poor young versus old and it is not about black versus white its about the past versus the future watch obama speech  with 99 percent of precincts reporting obama had 55 percent of the vote clinton was second with 27 percent followed by edwards with 18 percent obamas victory capped a heated contest in south carolina the first democratic primary in the south and the first with a largely africanamerican electorate obama who is hoping to become the the nations first africanamerican president did well with black voters who made up about half of saturdays electorate according to exit polls black voters supported the illinois senator by a margin of more than 4to1 over his nearest rival exit polls indicate among white voters obama took about a quarter of the vote with clinton and edwards roughly splitting the remainder according to exit polls clinton congratulated obama and said she was excited

vote and help shape the future of this party and help shape the future of america he said  watch edwards rally supporters   our campaign from the very beginning has been about one central thing and that is to give voice to the millions of americans who have absolutely no voice in this democracy clinton beat obama only among elderly voters according to exit polls among voters 65 and older clinton beat obama 40 to 32 percent but obama handily defeated clinton in every other bracket and overall garnered 58 percent of the vote among 18 to 64yearolds while 23 percent of those voters picked clinton and half of those polled said both candidates shared blame for the rancor between the two camps of those who said one of the contenders was more to blame than the other 21 percent blamed clinton and 6 percent said obama its fairly obvious its not going to be over february 5 obama spokesman robert gibbs said edwards was born in south carolina and won the states primary four years ago when he was making his first bid for the white house  see voters head to the polls in south carolina   edwards had touted his native status and as the clinton and obama camps have squabbled edwards continued to

exit polls in the 2004 primary nearly a quarter decided either the day of the primary or in the three days prior who they would support but this year only 10 percent of this years voters waited until saturday to choose another 10 percent decided only in the last three days and 32 percent decided in the last month fortyseven percent made up their minds at least a month ago more than double the percentage of 2004 the early exit polls were taken from a sampling of 1269 voters statewide following a rough campaign between clinton and obama the two camps toned down the rhetoric in the past two days returning to the issues and concentrating their firepower on the republicans rather than on each other i think they the republicans should be gracious and just say we have messed this thing up so much we are just going to quit and  we shouldnt be reelected but i dont think that is what they are going to do clinton said south carolina is the last big test for the democrats before super tuesday february 5 when nearly two dozen states will hold either primaries or caucuses  including such delegaterich states as california new york new jersey and illinois florida holds its primary on tuesday

know that this individual had disguised his race i determined that i had made an error in judgment in recognizing an escaped prisoner at this party she wrote and she instructed her chief of staff to

8b6f228661fd5f3170dc2c2e6b353e1d6c3859ec,gametapcom  everyone wants to be more physically fit but the toughest thing is finding motivation  the motivation to get started the motivation to keep going the motivation to push yourself to the next level a man tries out the wii fit at a nintendo launch party in central park new york city wii fit doesnt try to motivate you with before and after photos it doesnt try to motivate you with testimonials from fitness gurus it doesnt even offer you three easy payments but it does entice you to get into shape by making working out look like fun and that it does very well in fact wii fit might be some of the most fun you can have by just more or less standing still which must make it about as mass market friendly as any video game product ever was wii fit requires a wii of course and it comes bundled with a balance board but the entire setup doesnt take up much space and the board is no eyesore either unlike a bathroom scale thats usually squirreled away in a closet or shoved into the corner of a bathroom looking at it doesnt make you feel guilty designed to fit in with japanese living rooms where space is usually at a premium the balance board is sleek and elegantly designed ireportcom send us your wii fit review  it conveys cool asian style with a streamlined appearance its something you wouldnt mind having in your living room at all one thing about nintendo they know how to make hardware thats rugged but easy on the eyes getting started with wii fit is a snap but you might have to get some bad news out of the way first the balance board connects to the wii through a wifi connection you stand on it and use the wii remote to record your height and age the balance board then registers your weight from those figures wii fit calculates your body mass index bmi a standard metric many doctors use to determine a persons overall fitness which you can track over time oddly however theres no easy way to just use the scale to see your weight without recalculating your bmi each time the wii fitness program is organized into 48 activities divided among four general areas yoga aerobics strength training and balance games you can choose to work through all four in one session or just concentrate on one if youve never tried yoga before working through the 15 positions here are as good an introduction as any all of them are done with at least one foot on the balance board so wii fit can measure how centered you keep your body yoga is a great way to stretch muscles and joints out and to work on overall flexibility as meditative as this physical activity would seem youll feel the burn even before you reach any of the advanced forms once youre loosened up a little with yoga you might move on to aerobics the majority of these nine activities are basically variations of hula hooping jogging in place and simple step aerobics the one exception is rhythm boxing which you unlock later on by turning these aerobic challenges all into minigames wii fit entices you to keep working on them to earn better scores and ratings with the hula hoop for example you have to stand on the board and grind your hips to keep a virtual hoop twirling later you have to catch tossed hoops and then keep them all twirling too wii fit sets a mellow steady pace for all its aerobic challenges but it still manages to make your heart pump if just the words push and ups makes you break out in a sweat then youve probably already surmised that strength training contains some of the most physically demanding wii fit workouts the torso twist and rowing squat are easy but pushups planks and even the lunges will show you what youre made of the pushups in particular make you work extra hard you do pushups with your two hands on the board but because its 17  inches wide people over six feet tall or with broad shoulders might find themselves with their hands positioned inside their shoulder width while its certainly a worthwhile goal to build up to its difficult to snap off a set of pushups from that position the balance games require you to just apply pressure to the board through your feet skiing slaloms and ski jumping are fairly straightforward but you can also walk a tightrope or try to float down a river inside a giant bubble all of these are simple and fun and they really do make you aware of how well you maintain good posture and keep your balance however they are also short and very limited in the variety of levels and layouts could you do all these exercises and balance activities right now without wii fit sure you could but would you thats where the wii fit balance board comes in just like the wii itself it just looks like something youd like to try out but once you take that first step onto it you might find yourself on the way to becoming more fit read about video games watch video game news play complete original console arcade and pc games  free visit

nomination tuesday night with a sweep of gop contests in four states i am very very grateful and pleased to note that tonight my friends we have won enough delegates to claim with confidence humility and a great sense of responsibility that i will be the republican nominee for president of the united states mccain told supporters in texas cnn estimates that mccain has amassed 1195 delegates to the gops september convention in minneapolisst paul minnesota four more than the 1191 needed to claim the partys nomination now we begin the most important part of our campaign to make a respectful determined and convincing case to the american people that our campaign and my election as president given the alternative presented by our friends in the other party is in the best interest in the country that we love mccain said the big battles to come he said i do not underestimate the significance nor the size of the challenge  watch mccain address supporters after sweeping tuesdays contests   mccains last leading rival former arkansas gov mike huckabee bowed out of the race after his projected losses in texas ohio rhode island and vermont and urged his supporters to back the arizona senator in november its now important that we turn our attention not to what could have been or what we wanted to have been but now what must be and that is a united party huckabee said  watch as huckabee ends his presidential bid   claiming the title of presumptive nominee will give  mccain a head start on the general election campaign while democratic contenders hillary clinton and barack

said obama told mccain he looks forward to running against him in the fall campaign spokeswoman jennifer psaki said mccain is slated to go to the white house on wednesday to receive the endorsement of president bush according to two republican sources the arizona senators campaign  his second run for the white house  was largely written off last summer amid outspoken opposition from the partys conservative base a major staff shakeup and disappointing fundraising but the former navy pilot and vietnam prisoner of war rebounded with wins in januarys primaries in new hampshire and south carolina the state where his first presidential bid foundered there were times obviously when my political campaign was not viewed as the most viable in america as you probably know he told reporters in san antonio earlier tuesday in fact i was reminded of the words of chairman mao who said its always darkest before its totally black mccains fortunes also rebounded as us commanders in iraq credited the 2007 launch of a campaign to pacify baghdad and its surrounding provinces with a sharp decline in american and iraqi casualties the senator had been one of the most outspoken advocates of the shift and has blasted his potential democratic rivals for calling for the withdrawal of us combat troops from the widely unpopular war this is a man with a lot of trials in his life said former education secretary william bennett a cnn contributor hes had a lot of downs hes been up and this is a big up mccain has been turning his fire on the democrats for whom tuesdays races in ohio and texas are seen as pivotal  see scenes from tuesdays voting   but democrats have been pounding mccain over his january comment that he would be satisfied if us troops remained in iraq for 100 years as long as the insurgency there died down and democratic national committee chairman howard dean has attacked his reputation as a reformer over the past week accusing mccain of trying to evade federal spending limits by opting out of public financing after using the promise of federal funds to obtain a bank loan and automatic ballot access for his primary campaign dean told cnn on tuesday that mccain really is the focus of what were doing now in terms of his ethics problems and his problems with the war and his problems with the huge deficits that theyve run up on the republican side in 2000 mccain upset thentexas gov george w bush in the new hampshire primary by touting straight talk and his record as a republican maverick bush came back in south carolina amid a divisive and bitter campaign that left mccain denouncing leaders of the partys religious conservative wing as agents of intolerance and bush went on to win the presidency since then mccain has enraged conservative leaders by opposing bushs signature tax cuts cosponsoring the campaign finance reform law that now bears his name and supporting a controversial white housebacked plan to offer a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants but their support was spread among a fractured gop field and their main standardbearer former massachusetts gov mitt romney quit the race after a disappointing showing in februarys super tuesday primaries exit polls in texas and ohio found that about threequarters of republicans would be satisfied with mccain as their nominee however those surveys found that the economy was the top issue for gop voters in both states  and by a wide margin in ohio which has seen a sharp decline in manufacturing jobs in the past decade although national security issues are a strong suit for mccain castellanos said he might need some help if a weakening economy is the central issue in november its never been sen mccains strength castellanos said he said mccain would need to make the case that im going to grow this economy barack or hillary theyre going to grow government mccain had amassed 1047 delegates before tuesday according to cnn estimates at stake in tuesdays

7d8e196095e4561ee4f01c650101f5591fce4a8d,cnn   austrian investigators monday released more details about the elaborate underground cellar where josef fritzl kept his daughter imprisoned for 24 years along with three of their children josef fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children investigators believe fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978 shortly after according to his daughter he began raping her at age 11 or 12 said police spokesman franz polzer the 73yearold austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year and simply added the hidden space  which was not recorded in any building plans  polzer said it took fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition polzer said investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison which was blocked by a 500kilogram 1100pound steel and concrete door that fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance polzer said fritzl who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison you would have to open up a total of eight doors and  for the last door which would go into this space where the family was imprisoned you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus polzer said we will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we havent discovered yet and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter elisabeth captive in the dungeon under the fritzl home for decades repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children  six of whom survived three of the children were adopted by josef fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep the story of the familys imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago when one of the children still in the dungeon 19yearold kerstin fritzl fell seriously ill with convulsions the father agreed to take her to a hospital the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers dr albert reiter who is treating kerstin said monday that while her condition is still grave it has improved somewhat she has become more stable but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help reiter said noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother rosemarie who police say knew nothing about the basement prison they were also reunited with the three children that josef had taken from elisabeth the reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight  something the two boys had never seen  according to the clinics chief doctor the mother and the smallest child have in just the last couple of days increased their sensitivity to light dr berthold kepplinger said so we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses fiveyearold felix is getting more and more lively kepplinger said hes fascinated by everything that he sees around him  the fresh air the light and the food  all of these things are helping them he said slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal shade he also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family kepplinger praised elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity he said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family and the children make their beds however he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in fritzls home he said the mother elisabeth takes breaks and naps several times a day the health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying kepplinger said kepplinger said the children after being confined to a small space their entire lives are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces initially the dungeon where fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters in 1993 around the time elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child fritzl decided to add to the dungeon building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters on wednesday or thursday prosecution authorities will attempt to question fritzl  who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession state prosecutor

was under the control of british forces but they were unable to contain the violence and withdrew in september last year women bore the brunt of the militias extremist ideologies the militants

minister also has flooded the city with additional troops bringing in soldiers from western iraq along with their american advisers now the citizens have started to trust the iraqi security forces

less dumb than a brick unfortunately for scotus subsequent theologians took a dim view of all those who championed his viewpoint these scotists dunsmen or dunses were considered hairsplitting meatheads and eventually just dunces 2slipping a mickey  when you have to drug somebody against their will hey you gotta do what you gotta do it just wouldnt sound right to slip em a ricardo a bjorn or an evelyn its gotta be a mickey at the turn of the 20th century mickey finn was a chicago saloon owner in one of the seediest parts of town  and he fit right in finn was known for serving mickey

shoes never a host of the year candidate this mickey seems to have thoroughly earned his legacy so dont hesitate to use it the next time you drug and rob your own customers 3 spoonerism  reverend william archibald spooner 18441930 was famous for his muddled oneliners and though its hard to know which ones he actually said lines such as i have a halfwarmed fish and yes indeed the lord is a shoving leopard still prove that the soundswitching flub is pretty charming as far as mistakes go the spoonerism has even been used as a literary technique by poets and fiction writers giving spooner little reason to roll over  or otherwise inarticulately protest  in his grave 4 lynch  although several lynches not including david have been investigated by inquisitive etymologists virginia native charles lynch 17361796 is most likely the man behind the murderous word lynch was a patriot a planter and a judge but when he headed a vigilante court to punish tories british loyalists during the american revolution he decided to play the roles of jury and executioner too lynch has more than earned his besmirched name in fact he did half the besmirching himself by egotistically referring to his actions as lynch law and lynching 5 shrapnel  while battling napoleons army english general henry shrapnel 17611842 noticed that originalflavor cannonballs just werent massacring enough enemies for his liking so to get more shebang for his shilling he filled the cannonballs with bullets and exploding charges these shrapnel shells or shrapnelbarrages were pretty darn effective and later designs proved even more successful in world war i shrapnel didnt get much credit for the innovation during his lifetime but he ultimately contributed to enough death and misery that he pretty much deserves to be synonymous with a violent metallic byproduct of combat 6 draconian  a lexisnexis news search shows that folks are still talking about draconian policies draconian penalties and most frighteningly draconian sex rules though athenian lawgiver draco is not entirely confirmed to have existed if he were real then around 621 bce he instituted two timehonored traditions 1 writing laws down and 2 making laws that were batcrapinsane  they include ascribing the death penalty to such atrocities as being lazy whizzing in an alley and stealing an apple apparently he justified his measures with a sort of nonlogic along the lines of jaywalkers deserve to die and i cant do anything worse to mass murderers so whatre you gonna do 7 boycott  in a nutshell boycott got boycotted charles cunningham boycott 18321897 was a retired english army captain who claimed his unwanted fame in 1880 when the irish land league decided to punish him for not lowering his rents this thennew strategy which was a mere paragraph in the russiannovelsize saga of irish land reform was a kind of systematic shunning in which boycott was cut off from servants supplies mail and lifestyle free of death threats he might have been an evil landlord but if boycott could see just how successful his name became hed probably be a very sad regretful evil landlord 8 tawdry  the story of st audrey also known as st etheldreda is a classic example of how bad names happen to good people st audrey was the daughter of the king of east anglia then the norfolk section of anglosaxon england who lived a monasteryfounding selfabdicating life but when she died of the plague in 679 she was sporting a pretty nastylooking tumor on her neck which gossipmongers blamed on her penchant for wearing audacious necklaces in her youth after her death silk scarves called st audrey laces were sold in her honor at elys annual st audreys fair then the british tendency for dropping letters and syllables took over and audrey became tawdry it was a short trip from there to the dictionary and tawdry has been synonymous with gaudy ever since 9 chauvinism  nicolas chauvin was an early 19thcentury french soldier who was so patriotic and nationalistic he gave patriotism and nationalism a bad name  or at least a new name a slave to the cult of napoleon chauvin shed his fair share of blood for the emperor how did napoleon show his appreciation by giving chauvin a ceremonial saber a ribbon and a pittance of a pension later however french dramatists began basing berpatriotic characters on chauvin which paved the way for the soldiers ultimate reward a dubious spot in the english language email to a friend  for more mentalfloss articles visit mentalflosscom  entire contents of this article copyright mental

among latinos who are disproportionately catholic shes also winning catholic reagan democrats meaning socially conservative bluecollar voters obamas recent gaffe telling a crowd in san francisco california that smalltown americans were clinging to guns or religion out of economic frustration may help cement that advantage once the democrats settle on a candidate the catholic vote seems wide open in november sen john mccain the presumptive republican nominee appeals to many catholics because hes prolife and has a moderate stance on immigration yet his willingness to remain in iraq for 100 years is at odds with the churchs opposition to the war either clinton or obama could make a strong appeal to catholics on peaceandjustice issues yet both are out of sync with catholic teaching on issues such as abortion stemcell research and gay rights both sides are expected to court catholics aggressively the mccain campaign recently formed a national catholics for mccain committee led by former kansas sen sam brownback and former oklahoma gov frank keating along with a whos who of prominent catholic conservatives obama has his own national catholic advisory council led by casey and former indiana rep tim roemer both prolife democrats clinton likewise has topdrawer catholic advisers pope benedicts trip is unlikely to offer a decisive boost to either side hell probably strike prolife notes that republicans can exploit but hell also likely accent peace concern for the poor and the environment issues that generally skew to the democrats  watch as cnns rosemary church speaks with vatican analyst john allen about the popes visit   any political fallout may thus depend on what happens to the popes message once its swept up into the sausage grinder of american spin benedict xvi usually speaks not in sound bites but in carefully crafted paragraphs which sometimes leaves the door ajar for competing explanations of what he really means one can expect a war for the microphone among republican and democratic operatives each looking to exploit pieces of the popes message in a tight race movement of even a few percentage points among catholics could be decisive one sign the democrats understand whats at stake is that house speaker nancy pelosi has arranged an april 16 conference call with reporters to comment on benedicts trip  in effect not wanting president bush and by extension the republicans to claim a monopoly on the pope all this makes the political implications of the popes presence difficult to anticipate the best advice boils down to that classic

limit in the country stands by interstate 10 outside of the west texas town of el paso since 1995 states have been free to set their own maximum speed limits leading to long debates on safety standards to some folks the speed limits are just insane  either too low or too high depending on their views about what makes driving safe advocates of low speed limits wont find much to like about texas true to its frontier roots it stands out as the land of the fast getaway the top rural speed limit is normally 70 mph but in 2006 it set a maximum daytime speed of 80 miles per hour the highest speed limit on the country on more than 500 miles of rural interstate in its southwest corner this includes parts of interstate 10 between kerrville and el paso and of i20 between monahans and the i10 interchange the speed limit for rural roads in montana is 75 mph as a result it takes just three hours to travel the 228 miles from billings to butte at the posted speed but thats much slower than a montana driver could have made the trip in early 1999 at that time there was a sixmonth speeders honeymoon when the state had almost no control over rural speeds partly as a result of an unfavorable court ruling st thomas in the us virgin islands is at or near the other end of the spectrum in the us territory the speed limit is 20 mph in the city and 30 out in the country when it comes to accident rates though you would be far better off on a montana interstate than competing with the islands frenetic drivers on the way to paradise point nationwide maximum speeds range from 60 miles per hour in hawaii to 75 in most of the west meanwhile much of the eastern midwest and the northeast has opted for maximum speeds of 65 mph although michigan and indiana chose the 70 mph standard more common to the south and the great plains states so if you are cruising west along i90 out of ohio you can enjoy the increase in speed across 150 miles of indiana before illinois lower speed limit  or its state police  reins you in as you continue west interstate speed limits bump up to 70 in iowa and then you can maintain a steady 75 from nebraska through to the california line where interstate speeds drop off to 70 again should you choose to detour into oregon youre back down to 65 from a highway safety standpoint the patchwork of speed limits at least seems to make sense speeds are slower in more populous eastern states and faster in the wideopen west although the insurance institute for highway safety argues that some of the new higher speed limits out west and elsewhere are costing lives it estimates that deaths on interstates and freeways have increased 15 percent due to the higher speed limits but some researchers are skeptical about the link between accidents and high speeds on rural highways if not on city streets and rural twolanes they point to the lower fatality rates on european highways even though the speeds are generally higher the maximum legal speed is roughly 80 mph in poland austria france and a few other countries there is no speed limit on much of germanys autobahn although some sections are restricted to about 80 mph or less ironically the new regime of us speed limits has helped researchers make sense of whether higher rural speed limits are dangerous political scientist robert yowell a professor at northeast lakeview college in texas examined what happened after states began setting higher rural speed limits in 1995 with the federal 65 mph limit gone it was possible to compare the accident rates before and after the new limits went into effect the results were clear by and large across the 50 states there was no discernible effect from the higher limits yowell said two or three states actually had a decrease in fatalities once speed limits are raised on interstates drivers are more likely to get off the more dangerous two lanes and use the faster routes yowell said furthermore the motorists traveling the fastest on the higherspeed interstates tend to be good at that kind of driving the less competent drivers at high speeds tend to drive more slowly while yowell admits most states are wellintentioned hes not willing to accept that speed limits are solely a function of safety he said they are a function of revenue generation as well there have been cases of judges saying communities have to raise their speed limits because they were obviously being used to raise revenues and thats not a proper use of the law in part yowell looks to differences in political cultures to explain the great continental divide in speed limits it may be that certain states have a different approach to questions involving personal liberty versus collective safety he said his research doesnt surprise jim baxter president of the waunakee wisconsinbased national motorists association his organization had lobbied heavily for an end to the federal limits baxters rule of thumb for computing the right speed limit is the traffic engineering standard known as the 85th percentile speed thats the speed that 85 percent of motorists drive at or below but it tends to be well above the speed limits that most jurisdictions set with the speed limit set at that level traffic tends to move smoothly reducing the risk of accidents baxter said if you put the limit below that speed some vehicles are traveling far more slowly than the fastest drivers creating the most dangerous conditions of all baxter argues that most drivers naturally tend to drive at speeds that suit the road conditions and their driving skills st thomas is a case in point albeit an extreme one with its congestion and rugged terrain the island is bereft of performance cars many of the vehicles are older pickups aging japanese compacts and suvs the treacherous conditions restrict speeds far more effectively than any local law as joe aubain executive director of the st thomasst john chamber of commerce puts it even if you wanted to go a whole lot faster you couldnt he said email to a friend ,"us drivers face patchwork of speed limits across the nation

opponent says that hell take on the special interests she said well he told people he stood up to the nuclear industry and passed a bill against them but he actually let the nuclear industry water down his bill  the bill never actually passed clinton was referring to a 2006 bill that obama drafted after an illinois nuclear power plant was found to have released radiation into surrounding groundwater obamas original bill would have required power plants to notify the public and government officials when any radiation was released but subsequent versions had less stringent reporting requirements the new york times reported the bill was never voted on by the full senate clinton also accused obama of supporting billions of dollars of breaks for the oil industry by voting for an energy bill she opposed and said he did not support the workers of a maytag corp plant that closed in his home state of illinois  watch clinton attack obama   reacting to clintons charges obama spokesman bill burton said his candidate doesnt need any lectures on special interests from the candidate whos taken more money from washington lobbyists than any republican running for president sen clinton may have said that attacks and distortions are the fun and exciting part of the campaign but theyre exactly what everyone else in america is tired of burton said in recent days clinton has challenged obamas ability to deliver on his rhetoric theres a big difference between us  speeches versus solutions talk versus action she said speeches dont put food on the table speeches dont fill up your tank or fill your prescription or do anything about that stack of bills that keeps you up at night her remarks in ohio echo statements she made a day earlier in mcallen texas when she said i am

get to the finals neither clinton nor obama is likely to pick up the 2025 delegates needed to win the nomination outright before the primary season ends in june mainly because democrats divvy up each states delegates in proportion to the candidates share of the popular vote  watch an outlook of the democratic race   the democratic nomination likely will be decided by the roughly 800 superdelegates which include party officers elected officials and activists obamas camp argues the superdelegates should support the candidate with the most popular support as indicated by a majority of pledged delegates going into the convention clintons campaign on the other hand says the superdelegates should support the candidate they think will be the best nominee in the general election as well as the best president  watch how the campaigns are fighting for superdelegates   moveonorg an influential liberal activist group on thursday said it would launch a petition drive calling on the superdelegates not to go against the popular vote the worst thing for the party and democracy is if all these new voters feel like the nomination was brokered in a backroom somewhere the

vietnam he is holding a c ration cnncom  readers shared their stories and memories of mres and c rations some of the responses have been edited for clarity and length here is a selection  michael reimers of gresham oregon mres are the fancy ones we had c rations probably left over from wwii for my 21st birthday in 1982 i was on border patrol at the czech border and my friends snuck in two beers and made a cake for me out of what was available they took a fruitcake that was in something like a tuna can tin and they mixed hot chocolate mix with grape jelly to make the frosting and added a candle and two german beers and we were in business out in the woods it was very cool being with all my buddies and them doing that for me ronald mervyn of burton michigan i served in the army from april 1985 to february 1988 mres were not all that bad i liked the chicken ala king the dehydrated potatoes patty and the chocolate chip cookies the best they were all edible i wish i could have brought some home to share with family and friends steven carrigan of salina kansas i served in the us marine corps did i eat mres you bet and a lot of them they get the job done but always needed a bit of spicing up tabasco sauce that someone would bring to the field usually cold weather affected them more than anything nothing worse than getting the beans and franks in cold weather the beans would be semihard and the franks rock solid the preservative that they are in gels up and looks like petroleum jelly had to carry them next to your body to get them warm to me the worst one was the chicken ala king disgusting the desserts were always good some guys had recipes that you could mix together two or three mres and have a pretty good meal if you had heat and the time to cook it even though i thought i left them behind when i left the military i still have them in the car during the winter and when i do ice fishing they are great in a pinch annette sweet of leavenworth kansas this is a different side of life all together i believe the best memories were how to heat your mre before they came out with the heating pouch spaghetti wow that was a good one the best way to serve it was to take your mre cheese a mini bottle of the tabasco that came in the pack and mix it all together and place on the hood of your humvee on a hot day or by the heater on a cold day umm good now the worst ever that i believe they came out with was the loaf i cant even say whether it was meat or vegetables but it really left a very heavy feeling in the pit of your stomach you can never forget the ham slices unfortunately they forgot to slice it it was about  inch thick filled with gristle and very salty very hard to digest the different assortments of all the mres were as i call them charms candy hard as a rock and stuck to your teeth tootsie roll huge and didnt taste like chocolate chicklet gum send you straight to the throne the peanut butter and crackers well a bit oily but i considered a keeper oh by the way they did have real coffee i believe it was tasters choice not sure though and fruit loaf what can you say about a loaf once a loaf always a loaf and staying with tradition of blended items you mixed a pack of the powered cream they gave you for the coffee in with just a smidgen of water and you had peaches ala mode i never went hungry but sometimes i never was full i have retired now and have come to appreciate what is good food its being a civilian sitting at a real table with silverware plate and glass looking back on where i came from and knowing that i cant go back in body but in spirit from a retired soldier just keeping it real to all my comrades that came before me with me and after me god bless you and thank you for all that you do suzanne

mres but i also had their predecessor the c ration crats as they were called came with a can opener called a p38 and were ok the mre has come a long way since its inception and the chicken ala king

cake was an acquired taste so instead of eating it they opened a petcock valve on the nearby helicopters and filled the cake and tin with aircraft fuel when lit the sponge cake would burn for hours and allow the men to heat the rest of their meal with it david hollingsworth of baltimore maryland i was a member of the 18th airborne corps fa b 58th artillery in august 1990 among the first troops from fort bragg to deploy in that area mres were considered pretty ok meals to eat until my unit was linked in a special mission with the french troops their rations were of something that came off of our dinner tables real food we would trade them every night for food until they realized what the big fuss was all about i know real sardines and things of that nature might not sound as appetizing as other foods however compared to the mres we were eating the french troops food was a delicacy to most mark grocki of birmingham michigan i have not served in the military but i have eaten mres on backpacking trips through michigan provided to me by a friends cousin who serves in the marines ive always looked forward to them and have found the entrees like mexican rice beef stew and ham and

and two friends  brothers deepak and satish kalpoe  met the women at a bar in oranjestad when they arrived he said the women appeared to have been drinking heavily and some were using cocaine holloway was in aruba with about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from mountain brook high school in suburban birmingham alabama after declining an invitation from holloway to dance on stage with her he agreed to drink a shot of liquor from her navel as she lay on the bar he said about 1 am may 30 he said she left the bar with him and the kalpoes telling her friends she would meet them at their hotel before their planned return flight the next day to the united states he said the three men previously told authorities they then drove to the beach with holloway leaving her there when she told them she wanted to stay but van der sloot gave a different account in the hiddencamera footage he said he wanted to have sex with holloway but she told him she did not want to go to her hotel

and holloway then had sex he said but as they were caressing each other she started shaking then said nothing he said all of a sudden what she did was like in a movie he said she was shaking it was awful  i prodded her there was nothing he said he panicked and when she did not appear to be alive shook her but was unable to resuscitate her he said he carried her body to a stand of trees walked to

body to the boat and the friend told van der sloot to go home he said the student then walked back to his house where his father was asleep when he arrived about 15 minutes later he recounted he

child she added not knowing is the absolute cruelest thing that a person can endure van der sloots attorney joe tacopina told abc monday that theres no confession theres no admission of a crime by joran on any of these tapes he said much of what was in the video is easily disprovable based on corroborative evidence  the fact of the matter is he still is not responsible the evidence not joran

cat with a bow in her hair and no mouth shintaro tsuji ceo of sanrio famous for its hello kitty brand speaks in the boardroom shes one of 450 characters developed by japans sanrio group but shes by far most popular  the embodiment of whats known in japan as kawaii or the culture of cute her image adorns some 50000 objects from cute of course to downright crazy but theres nothing cute about the numbers hello kitty is responsible for more than half of sanrios billion dollar annual turnover her creator and founder of sanrio is the effervescent 79yearold shintaro tsuji he told the boardrooms andrew stevens what he thinks is the marketing secret behind a cultural icon tsuji selling something which people want to buy is one of the ways of doing business but i thought goods that i want are also something other people want so we wanted to make goods which people want to send to somebody else as a gift the idea is that goods are for social communication purposes and that has been accepted worldwide in addition to give hello kitty goods as a present is very thoughtful our three concepts of friendship cuteness and thoughtfulness have been reaching out to people it conveys the importance of being friendly such gestures are necessary for the japanese nation you care about other people by sending some gifts those concepts have been accepted worldwide stevens my first question to you is sanrio has developed something like 450 characters why it is hello kitty has stood out so much more than the others what is the secret of its success tsuji at first we were using characters which were created by outsiders such as cartoonists or artists but in this case we had to pay the royalty so we decided to create our own characters we hired many artists and asked them to create various characters according to our own research the most popular animal character was a dog then a white cat and the third one was a bear snoopy already existed as a dog character  thats why we went for the second most popular character we asked the artists to design a character based on a white cat stevens let me just ask you a question about your life growing up reading your autobiography you lost your mother when you were 13 years old you went to live with your auntie and you describe your life your childhood has been a quite lonely how do you think that has shaped you in your business life tsuji i felt that the most important thing in your life is to have someone whom you can open up your heart to and talk about anything to have many friends whom you can talk with your heart is the most blessed thing in your life then i asked myself how can you make friends  in what way people can make a friend with those people that is not just to avoid behaving which makes people uncomfortable but do something which makes people happy in this way people can make friends for example when people are ill you can say something to them or when people did something for you you say thank you to them for those kinds of occasions you send a small present rather than an expensive gift it is important to show your appreciation since you are able to make good friends in this way this idea has formed as a business as a result hello kitty was created hello kitty has become known among everybody and it means that people are becoming friends i am pleased with this phenomenon stevens what in your business career is the most important lesson you think youve learnt tsuji a good company means that first of all its sale increases each year and secondly it makes profits each year this is what people call a quality company but this is not my main concern obviously a company shouldnt lose money a company cannot contribute to a society easily but for me it is important to establish a company which has a good reputation stevens much easier said than done how do you remain true to your original ideas though because there are so many pressures from shareholders among other people to make those profits tsuji the company shareholders actually say make more profits or dividends but what i always say to them at the general assembly is that the shareholder should be someone who truly values my company and is proud of having my companys share according to newspapers there are companies which make a profit by polluting the environment or breaking laws but this is not acceptable by our standard i bet the company staffs want to have an increase in the wages but i want my staffs to be proud of themselves in particular when their children ask them where they are working in my view that is very important stevens what advice would you give to someone starting out their own company in 21st century tsuji it is not only about making profits or establishing a huge corporation a bigger country doesnt mean a better country having a larger military capacity doesnt mean a better thing it will be ideal to establish a company which is a value to the world its not just about the money so i would say how about creating companies which people appreciate email to a friend ,"shintaro tsuji ceo of sanrio speaks to andrew stevens in the boardroom

william fallon told cnn he resigned to maintain confidence in the military chain of command during an interview tuesday on cnns american morning fallon denied a magazine articles assertion that he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with iran cnns kyra phillips asked fallon about his resignation and about us policy regarding iraq and iran kyra phillips how were you informed that this was it who called you fallon the story is  the facts are that the situation was one that was very uncomfortable for me and im sure for the president one of the most important things in the military is confidence in the chain of command and the situation that developed was one of uncertainty and a feeling that maybe that i was disloyal to the president and that i might be trying to countermand his orders the policies of the country  the fact that people might be concerned that i was not appropriately doing what i was supposed to do and following orders bothered me and my sense was that the right thing to do was to offer my resignation  watch fallon break his silence   phillips do you feel you were pushed out fallon what was important was not me it wasnt some discussion about where i was with issues it was the fact that we have a war in progress we had a couple of hundred thousand people whose lives were at stake out in iraq and afghanistan and we needed to be focused on that and not a discussion on me or what i might have said or thought or someone perceived i said thats the motivation phillips esquire magazine writer tom barnett made it appear that you were the only man standing between the president and a war with iran is that true fallon i dont believe for a second president bush wants a war with iran the situation with iran is very complex people sometimes portray it or try to portray it in very simplistic terms  were against iran we want to go to war with iran we want to be close to them  the reality is in international politics that there are many aspects to many of these situations and i believe in our relationship with iran we need to be strong and firm and convey the principles on which this country stands and upon which our policies are based at the same time demonstrate a willingness and openness to engage in dialogue because there are certainly things we can find in common phillips would have you negotiated with iran fallon its not my position to negotiate with iran i was the military commander in the middle east i had responsibility for our people and their safety and wellbeing its the role of the diplomats to do the negotiation phillips so when talk of the third war came out a war with iran the president didnt say to you this is what i want to do and did you stand up and say no sir bad move fallon its probably not appropriate to try to characterize it in that way again dont believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with iran we have a lot of things going on and there are many other ways to solve problems i was very open and candid in my advice im not shy i will tell people the leaders what i think and offer my opinions on iran and other things and continue to do that phillips do you think that cost you your job fallon no i dont believe so at all its a confidence issue of do people really believe the chain of command is working for them or do we have doubts and if the doubts focus attention away from what the priority issues ought to be then weve got to make a change phillips we talk about your nononsense talk and the fact that you had no problems standing up to the president your critics say that admiral fallon is a difficult man to get along with are you fallon you probably could ask my wife about that she would have a few things to say i think that whats really important here is that when i was asked to take this job about a year and a half ago i believe it was because we were facing some very difficult days in iraq and afghanistan and in the region i had some experience in dealing with international problems i certainly had a lot of combat experience and i was brought in in an attempt to make things better thats what i went about doing again there are things that are important and other things in life that are less so a lot of the issues that became points of discussion to me were not really important items the important items were the people what theyre doing how to get this job done how to get the war ended and get our people home phillips hillary clinton and barack obama talk about pulling troops out by next year john mccain says no weve got to stay the course what is the best course for iraq right now  watch what the candidates say about war policy   fallon i believe the best course is to retain the high confidence we have in general dave petraeus and his team out there dave has done a magnificent job in leading our people in that country again this situation is quite complex  many angles theres a very very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country but thats not going to be successful as we know without lots of other people playing a hand the political side of things in iraq has got to move forward that appears to be improving people have to have confidence in their futures they want to have stability they would like to be able to raise their families in peace they would like to have a job they would like to look to tomorrow as better than today it takes more than the military but the military is essential to provide stability and security the idea we would walk away from iraq strikes me as not appropriate we all want to bring our troops home we want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended given where we are today the progress that theyve made particularly in the last couple months i think its very very heartening to see whats really happened here the right course of action is to continue to work with the iraqis and let them take over the majority of the tasks for ensuring security for the country and have our people come out on a timetable thats appropriate to conditions on the ground,"former central command

parliamentary senate and local council seats meaning voters have to cast a number of ballots in a limited amount of time limited voter education means many registered voters were not told which ward to go to and may turn up at the wrong polling stations  watch claims of dead voters still on the rolls   the absence of international media and independent observers has heightened critics concerns

but now it is difficult to get even basic food supplies inflation has skyrocketed to more than 100000 percent while food production and agricultural exports have dropped drastically  watch reasons for meltdown of zimbabwes economy   part of the economic freefall is traced to mugabes land redistribution policies including his controversial seizure of commercially whiteowned farms in 2000 mugabe gave the land to black zimbabweans who he said were cheated under colonialist rule and white farmers who resisted were jailed in 2005 mugabe launched operation clean out the trash in which he razed slum

ca5c0c816376354b82a4a7b9fa9a31b655e2d2cd,los angeles california cnn  the transportation security administration said friday its officers at a texas  airport appear to have properly followed procedures when they allegedly forced a woman to remove her nipple rings  one with pliers  but acknowledged the procedures should be changed the woman involved  mandi hamlin  told reporters earlier friday she was humiliated by last months incident in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male tsa officers nearby the incident occurred at the lubbock texas airport the officers rightly insisted that the alarm that was raised be resolved the tsa said in a statement posted on its web site friday afternoon tsa supports the thoroughness of the officers involved as they were acting to protect the passengers and crews of the flights departing lubbock that day however tsa has reviewed the procedures themselves and agrees that they need to be changed the statement said in the future tsa will inform passengers that they have the option to resolve the alarm through a visual inspection of the article in lieu of removing the item in question hamlin and her lawyer celebrity attorney gloria allred said they want a public apology from the agency as well as a guarantee that future passengers with piercings will be treated with dignity and respect allred pointed out that tsas web site says passengers with piercings can undergo a patdown inspection if they do not want to take their piercings out  an option she said hamlin was never offered the conduct of tsa was cruel and unnecessary allred told reporters at a news conference last time that i checked a nipple was not a dangerous weapon she said if an apology was not forthcoming mandi is going to have to consider her legal options attempts by cnn to reach allred for a response to the tsa statement friday afternoon were unsuccessful tsa said in its statement it acknowledges that our procedures caused difficulty for the passenger involved and regrets the situation in which she found herself we appreciate her raising awareness on this issue and we are changing the procedures to ensure that this does not happen again the incident occurred february 24 as hamlin 37 was preparing to fly to dallasfort worth from lubbock where she had been visiting her elderly greatuncle hamlin said she also has navel and ear piercings and has never set off a metal detector or been singled out for additional screening at an airport she did not set off the metal detector at lubbock international airport but was pulled to the side for additional screening allred said a hand wand used by a tsa officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts hamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings allred said and that officer called over another officer who told her she would need to remove them ms hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings allred said reading from a letter she sent tsa after nipple rings are inserted the skin can often heal around the piercing and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove in addition once removed the pierced skin may close up almost immediately making it difficult and painful to reinsert the piercing more officers were called over and the group grew to four male and two female tsa officers according to hamlin also a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather the officers insisted that hamlin remove the nipple rings allred said she felt humiliated by the scene that the tsa officers were making allred said with tears streaming down her face she again asked to show the piercings to a tsa officer instead of having to remove them she was told however she would not be allowed to fly unless she removed them had she been told that she had a right to a patdown she would have chosen that option she eventually was taken to a private area behind a curtain to remove the piercings allred said one came out easily but the other would not and she called to an officer that she was having trouble and would need pliers she was handed a large pair allred said as ms hamlin struggled to remove the piercing behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male tsa officers snickering in the background allred said in the letter mandi hamlin was publicly humiliated  clearly this is not how passengers should be treated  watch the passenger demonstrate removing the jewelry   afterward hamlin underwent another scan but realized she had forgotten to remove her navel ring she offered to remove it allred said but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it hamlin wondered why a similar visual inspection of her nipple rings would not have sufficed allred said i wouldnt wish this experience upon anyone hamlin told reporters i felt surprised embarrassed humiliated and scared no one deserves to go through this in a statement earlier friday the tsa said it is well aware of terrorists interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body therefore we have a duty to the american public to resolve any alarm that we discover tsa included in its statement a picture of a prototype training device it will use to simulate a bra bomb in training and testing its officers hamlin said she had to visit the person who originally pierced her nipples to get the rings reinserted and said the process was excruciatingly painful because of the scar tissue that had formed people who are pierced should not be snickered at should not become the object of ridicule should not be singled out for special and uneven and unequal treatment allred said they should be respected just like everybody else she said she had received a call from tsas public affairs office friday morning we hope that means theyre going to jump on this and do something about it she said we want tsa to do the right thing now were going to give them the opportunity

ee6568a8880e61a498aab80c41f70939d567c991,cnn   austrian investigators monday released more details about the elaborate underground cellar where josef fritzl kept his daughter imprisoned for 24 years along with three of their children josef fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children investigators believe fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978 shortly after according to his daughter he began raping her at age 11 or 12 said police spokesman franz polzer the 73yearold austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year and simply added the hidden space  which was not recorded in any building plans  polzer said it took fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition polzer said investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison which was blocked by a 500kilogram 1100pound steel and concrete door that fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance polzer said fritzl who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison you would have to open up a total of eight doors and  for the last door which would go into this space where the family was imprisoned you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus polzer said we will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we havent discovered yet and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter elisabeth captive in the dungeon under the fritzl home for decades repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children  six of whom survived three of the children were adopted by josef fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep the story of the familys imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago when one of the children still in the dungeon 19yearold kerstin fritzl fell seriously ill with convulsions the father agreed to take her to a hospital the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers dr albert reiter who is treating kerstin said monday that while her condition is still grave it has improved somewhat she has become more stable but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help reiter said noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother rosemarie who police say knew nothing about the basement prison they were also reunited with the three children that josef had taken from elisabeth the reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight  something the two boys had never seen  according to the clinics chief doctor the mother and the smallest child have in just the last couple of days increased their sensitivity to light dr berthold kepplinger said so we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses fiveyearold felix is getting more and more lively kepplinger said hes fascinated by everything that he sees around him  the fresh air the light and the food  all of these things are helping them he said slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal shade he also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family kepplinger praised elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity he said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family and the children make their beds however he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in fritzls home he said the mother elisabeth takes breaks and naps several times a day the health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying kepplinger said kepplinger said the children after being confined to a small space their entire lives are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces initially the dungeon where fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters in 1993 around the time elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child fritzl decided to add to the dungeon building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters on wednesday or thursday prosecution authorities will attempt to question fritzl  who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession state prosecutor

d7eaf2e5ca91bf54c05ead867e5e90728d44e218,editors note glenn beck is on headline news nightly at 7 and 9 et glenn beck says to always question conventional wisdom new york cnn  the people who survived the great depression were the ones who had money to buy when everybody else was selling  my grandfather  i learned a lot from my grandfather but that might have been the greatest lesson he ever taught me he wasnt just talking about managing money he was talking about managing life  and his words have stuck with me since i was a child a few years back i was taking a theology course and the professor recommended only the books whose authors he agreed with i read those books but i also asked that professor which books he thought had it completely wrong  and i read those too then i made up my own mind after all following the herd is fine until they all run off the side of a cliff together less than a year ago a recession was the last thing on anyones mind in fact over the summer as i was questioning the conventional wisdom i read an article on my television show that quoted a financial expert as saying it is the strongest global market that weve seen in the history of measuring these things thats when i realized how fast the herd was approaching the cliff but with predictions of a recession now more common than fed rate cuts  and thats saying something  maybe now its time to look at a worstcase scenario after all considering all sides of an issue no matter how extreme they may be doesnt make you a crazy person it makes you an educated one so to understand what a real meltdown could look like i turned to nouriel roubini chairman of rge monitor and professor of economics at new york universitys stern school of business hes also a former adviser to the us treasury department professor roubini recently laid out what he called the 12 steps to financial disaster unfortunately they were really complicated and i have severe add so ive boiled them down into five phases that even a rodeo clown like me can understand i think of these like our militarys defcon  or defense readiness condition  scale except that this countdown could end in the meltdown of your bank account   defconomy five  how youll know were here the housing downturn turns into a free fall making it the worst collapse in our countrys history that not only triggers massive numbers of foreclosures and lost household wealth but it also sets off another large wave of bank writedowns odds we get here  roubini told me that its extremely likely even unavoidable that we hit this stage because the excess supply of new homes in the market is like weve never seen before prices he believes need to fall another 10 to 20 percent before that clears  defconomy four  how youll know were here americans upsidedown on their mortgages and unable to pay their home equity loans begin defaulting on other debt like credit cards car loans and student loans in addition bond insurance companies lose their perfect credit ratings forcing already troubled banks to write down another 150 billion odds we get here high roubini says that 8 million households are already upsidedown on their mortgages and he thinks we could see that number go to between 16 million  and 24 million by the end of 2009 a lot of those people he believes will simply walk away from their homes and send their keys back to the bank  defconomy three  how youll know were here  some banks begin to crack under the pressure of continuing writedowns and mounting defaults by consumers a national or large regional bank finally collapses triggering hedge fund failures and general chaos on wall street potentially leading to a 1987style market crash odds we get here  very good roubini says that well likely socialize the losses effectively nationalizing the mortgages or the banks it would be he told me like northern rock the large bank in england that was recently taken over by the british government times three he thinks the stock market will head south throughout the year as fears about a severe recession are confirmed  defconomy two  how youll know were here  most forms of credit both to consumers and businesses become virtually nonexistent that results in a vicious circle of additional writedowns stock market losses and bank collapses which leads to even less credit being available odds we get here  good roubini says that credit conditions are becoming worse everyday across a variety of markets and wont be getting better anytime soon without extra credit available people might have to actually gasp live within their means  defconomy one  how youll know were here  welcome back to 1929 a full economic meltdown results in a complete failure of the underlying financial system what will be known to future generations as the greater depression has arrived odds we get here not likely roubini believes that this will be a very painful and severe recession that could last for 18 months or more but it will be more like 1981 than 1929 families may be eating soup again but at least itll be in their own kitchens now do i think any of what you just read will happen i have no idea and thats exactly the problem im not an economist or a stockbroker im just a guy trying to make the best decisions i can and picking the brains of real experts helps me do that but i do know one thing for sure depressions arent advertised in advance last time around we went from the roaring 20s to bread lines in a matter of just a few years anyone who says that cant happen again either doesnt know history doesnt understand how interconnected the worlds economies have become or is lying to you while that doesnt mean you should panic it does mean you should prepare  something my grandfather wouldve done a long time ago email to a friend ,"glenn beck lays out the defconomy scale 
beck ponders will the economy collapse into the greater depression
maybe now its time to look at a worstcase scenario he says 
then again maybe not be prepared is the key ", glenn beck says to always question conventional wisdom. Nouriel roubini recently laid out what he called the 12 steps to financial disaster. Roubini says that 8 million households are already upsidedown on their mortgages. He thinks we could see that number go to between 16 million  and 24 million by the end of 2009.

punishments meted out in two racially charged incidents officers lead al sharpton center through jena louisiana during thursdays protest they swarmed over the grounds of jena high school where nooses were hung from a tree in early august 2006 about three months before six black teens known as the jena 6 were accused of beating a white classmate while the tension was palpable news broke thursday afternoon that the 3rd circuit court of appeal ordered a hearing within 72 hours to determine if the only one of the six still behind bars can be released the order has got to be good mychal bells attorney bob noel told cnn it means we have a day in court any day in court is going to be a good day earlier there was an aura of a pilgrimage at the site where the controversial tree once stood before school administrators had it removed many people touched the ground and some retrieved a lump of dirt said cnns eric marrapodi he said the part of the town he was in was illprepared for the crowds  no water or toilets were available in the background groups shouted black power and no justice no peace the estimated 15000 to 20000 demonstrators shut down the town of 3000 in central louisiana many residents left for the day and government agencies businesses and schools were closed sgt tim ledet of the louisiana state police said protesters in buses were still bringing people to town at midday because of the gridlock but many protesters got off and walked into town on foot there is just no room to maneuver in this small town he said jena resident terry adams disagreed with any accusations that there might be a blackwhite divide in the area we are not a racial town we get along with each other we get along fine this is something that got out of proportion it really has jenas racial tensions were aggravated in august 2006 when three white teens hung the nooses the day after a group of black students received permission from school administrators to sit under the tree  a place where white students normally congregated the guilty students were briefly suspended from classes despite the principals recommendation they be expelled according to donald washington us attorney for the western district of louisiana a member of the lasalle parish school board  which had a role in supporting suspension instead of expulsion  insisted the board is not prejudiced the panel felt it took the appropriate action jonny fryar said i talked to one of the parents who called me and said their son thought it was a prank and naive to the fact of what it meant and he was sorry he said i hate to see people label us as something we are not because we have black students and white students playing football together they shake hands get along this is an unfortunate incident we hope that the community can heal although washington acknowledged the fbi and other investigators thought the noose incident bore the markings of a hate crime a decision was made not to press federal charges because the case didnt meet federal criteria the students were under 18 and had no prior records and no group such as a ku klux klan was found to be behind their actions on december 4 about three months after the nooses were discovered six teens dubbed the jena 6 were accused of beating classmate justin barker the six  mychal bell robert bailey jr carwin jones bryant purvis theo shaw and jesse ray beard  were originally charged with attempted seconddegree murder and conspiracy according to lasalle parish district attorney reed walters bell the only one of the six who remains in jail was to be sentenced thursday after convictions for aggravated seconddegree battery and conspiracy to do the same but both charges have been vacated awaiting further action by the district attorney charges for bailey jones and shaw also were reduced to battery and conspiracy when they were arraigned while purvis still awaits arraignment the charges for beard who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime are unavailable because hes a juvenile tina jones purvis mother condemned walters i hope that the da will wake up and realize that hes doing the wrong thing and to release these kids she said its not equal the black people get the harsher extent of the law whereas white people get a slap on the wrist per se so it is not equal here jones maintained that her son was not involved in the beating but watched from a railing and was not arrested that same day we have a long fight ahead of us and well keep fighting until justice prevails in jena the mother said purvis who accompanied her was asked how hes faring im doing pretty good i hope there is a pretty good outcome of whats taking place today he said  watch an interview with one of the jena 6 and his mom   president bush who was asked about the rally at a news conference said the events in louisiana have saddened me i understand the emotions the justice department and the fbi are monitoring the situation down there all of us in america want there to be fairness when it comes to justice he advised whoever is elected next year to reach out to the africanamerican community hundreds of college students from historically black schools such as howard university in washington traveled to jena along with civil rights activists such as al sharpton and the rev jesse jackson who helped organize the event martin luther king iii also attended saying this is about justice for the six young men sharpton called jena the beginning of the 21st century civil rights movement theres a jena in every state jackson told the crowd in jena on thursday morning joann scales who brought her three teenage children on a twoday bus journey from los angeles california to jena made the same point the reason i brought my children is because it could have been one of them involved in an incident like the one in jena if this can happen to them the jena 6  it can happen to anyone scales said ondra hathaway was on the bus with scales if this young man bell was railroaded to do time as an adult how many more people has that happened to she said jackson said on cnns american morning on thursday that the charges against the black youths their possible jail terms if convicted and their bail amounts are excessive punishing the teens with probation would have been sufficient jackson said bails for the jena 6 were between 70000 and 138000 and all but bell have posted bond bell 17 has been in prison since his arrest the judge has refused to lower his 90000 bail citing bells record which includes four

it is much easier for us to have the argument when we have a nominee who says i always thought this was a bad idea  this was a bad strategy  he said clinton defended her vote saying she was told by the white house that it would be used initially to return weapons inspectors to see whether saddam hussein had an active weapons program see where they stand on iraq  i believe strongly that we needed to put inspectors in the new york senator said that was the underlying reason why i at least voted to give president bush the authority put those inspectors in let them do their work figure out what

other when they agreed  what does the debates cordial tone mean   obama got laughs when asked about how he might counter republican charges against taxandspend liberal democrats well first of all i dont think the republicans are going to be in a real strong position to argue fiscal responsibility when they have added 4 trillion or 5 trillion worth of national debt i am happy to have that

believed the more memorable his image the more memorable his whiskey some records show that jasper newton jack daniel came into the world on september 5 1846 his tombstone however says 1850 strange because his mother died in 1847 all of this might not normally matter but jacks birth date is important to his overall legend which proudly proclaims him the boy distiller so perhaps its best we begin when jack was first introduced to whiskey which we know was early in life leaving home at a young age jack struck out on his own with nothing more than a handful of items valued at 9 he ended up at the home of dan call a preacher at a nearby lutheran church and the owner of a general store there reverend call also happened to sell whiskey that he distilled himself jack quickly became determined to learn the craft in fact many storytellers claim the boy wonder bought the still from call and began pursuing the business fulltime at the ripe age of 16 if that legend is true then jack began selling his own tennessee whiskey only three years later the famous black labels on the company bottles proudly pronounce established and registered in 1866 in reality no documents support that myth jack may have been a teenage moonshiner but he didnt register his business with the federal government until 1875 and by then jack would have been the more boozeappropriate age of 29 the maker makes his mark  whatever legends exist one thing is certain jack daniel had a brilliant mind for marketing even as a youngster jack understood that if people remembered him they would remember his whiskey to that end he decked himself out in a formal kneelength coat a vest a tie and a widebrim planters hat and was never caught out of uniform again jack also established the jack daniels silver cornet band  a 10member outfit solely devoted to promoting his whiskey across the countryside with uniforms and instruments from the sears  roebuck catalog and a specially designed wagon for traveling jack made sure the band played every saloon opening fourth of july celebration and political rally around but perhaps jacks most brilliant decision concerned how to present his whiskey from the beginning jack had been one of the first sellers to stencil his distillery name on his whiskey jugs next he upgraded to round customembossed bottles but when a glass salesman showed him a prototype square bottle in 1895 jack realized hed stumbled upon something unique the new bottles not only stood out from the crowd but also had a shape that would prevent them from rolling around and breaking during transport in addition the square look reinforced the idea that jack was a square dealer who put honest work and high standards first whatever effort jack daniel put into his marketing he never let quality slip in 1904 the distiller decided on a whim to enter his whiskey in the taste competition at the st louis worlds fair it came as little surprise when he won lucky no 7  perhaps jacks greatest coup was the name he gave his highquality product  old no 7 naturally nobody seems to know why the official historian at the jack daniel distillery today says its the most oftasked question on factory tours as you might imagine many theories have been advanced jack had seven girlfriends jack believed the number seven was lucky jack was honoring a merchant friend who owned seven stores that distributed jacks liquor jack misplaced a batch of whiskey for seven years and upon finding it labeled it old no 7 none of these stories however makes as much sense as the lessthansexy explanation from jack daniel biographer peter krass simply put jack was originally assigned a district tax assessment number of 7 but when the irs consolidated districts within tennessee they arbitrarily reassigned him the number 16 jack didnt want to confuse his loyal consumers and he certainly didnt want to bend to the government so he began labeling his bottles old no 7 more than 125 years later this act of defiance still makes his labels stand out jack without jill  jack daniel never married some say its because he was married to his work others say its because he never found a girl who measured up to his high standards or perhaps its just that he was too busy catering to the greater lynchburg population  throwing elaborate christmas feasts hosting exquisite costume parties in his secondstory ballroom and donating money to every church in moore county but by all accounts jack was quite a ladies man he was a perfect dance partner a polite conversationalist and a fantastic giftgiver unfortunately he also gravitated toward girls young enough to be his daughter or even granddaughter once jack even asked for a womans hand in marriage but her father denied him  partly because jack enjoyed keeping his own legend alive and always hesitated to reveal his true birth date when jack proposed her father made it clear that any man unwilling to disclose his age was a little too old for such a young girl the early bird gets the gangrene  hard as it might be to believe in the end the great distiller actually died from getting to work too early as the story goes one morning in 1906 jack arrived at his office before anybody else he tried to access the company safe but had a terrible time remembering the code after a few frustrating minutes he kicked the safe as hard as he could he badly bruised his left foot and immediately began to walk with a limp the limp only grew worse with time and he later discovered the injury had led to blood poisoning then came gangrene then amputation and then five years later death its not the happiest ending for the story or the clearest cut but it is the best because it adds to the mystery and mystique of jack daniel as they say where facts cannot be found legends fill the empty space and thats perfectly fine for the keepers of the company flame after all as jack himself believed the more memorable his image the more memorable his

continuing to evolve much has been learned about the disorder since the mid1940s when dr leo kanner published his first paper identifying autistic children and dr hans asperger described a milder form of autism that became known as asperger syndrome autism is considered a spectrum disorder because the number and intensity of symptoms can greatly vary among those with autism autism spectrum disorders asd which are also known as pervasive developmental disorders can often be detected by the age of three asd is an umbrella term that includes the following diagnoses  divide your students into five groups and assign each group a different asd from the list above instruct each group to conduct research to learn about the symptoms characteristics and differentiated diagnoses associated with its assigned disorder then have groups prepare presentations of their findings that include a brief mock case study to illustrate how the disorders might manifest in a child after the presentations challenge students to identify the common traits associated with all autistic disorders all people with asd have impaired communication problems with social relationships and like to engage in repetitive motions ask students  following the discussion refer students back to autism is a world to make a list of the symptoms and behaviors that sue rubin displayed during the program then ask students based on what you know about ms rubin where would you say that her disability falls within the spectrum of autistic disorders 2 treating autism  point out to students that although autistic symptoms in children may lessen with age autism is a lifelong disorder there are various types of therapies available for treating autism including behavior modification sensory integration medications and dietary interventions however because the nature and severity of autistic symptoms and behaviors can vary no one approach works for every person according to the national institute of mental health most professionals agree that early intervention is important and that most individuals with asd respond well to highly structured specialized programs after you have shared this information pair students and assign each pair one of the following asd treatment approaches  biomedical treatments  cnn does not endorse any specific medication the information provided here is meant as an overview of the types of medications sometimes prescribed instruct each pair to investigate the philosophy protocols and benefits and drawbacks associated with its treatment method have pairs

seminary as an act of terrorism ambulance workers put one of the casualties from the seminary attack into an ambulance the council said libya  a new nonpermanent member  blocked the statement on thursday night ibrahim dabbashi libyas deputy ambassador to the united nations said the attack on the school was no different than israeli military offensives against militants in gaza but dan gillerman israels ambassador to the united nations said he saw no connection between thursdays shooting and israels operations in gaza this is not a story of retaliation he said these people have been terrorizing israel for years have been carrying out suicide bombings and indiscriminate attacks for years a gunman broke into the jewish seminary about 830 pm spraying automaticweapons fire authorities said most of the victims were students in their teens and 20s medical officials said at least nine others were wounded before an offduty israel defense forces officer fatally shot the gunman jerusalem district police commander aharon franko said the gunman was carrying an ak47 and a pistol  and had time to swap weapons during the massacre police are trying to identify the gunman and figure out how he managed while drawing little notice to enter the large threestory school in a bustling residential neighborhood there was no alert or warning about this attack franko said  watch the immediate aftermath of the attack   a first responder said the bodies were on the floor of the study hall surrounded by holy books no group has claimed responsibility for the attack video from thursdays scene showed a frantic crowd of rescue workers carrying bloodied victims into ambulances dozens of police officers were scouring the campus and streets around the yeshiva in case there were other gunmen outside the school scores of israeli men gathered from surrounding neighborhoods demanding justice for the attack authorities are calling the incident at west jerusalems merkaz harav yeshiva an act of terrorism the school is one of the largest seminaries in israel with about 500 students in the yeshiva and 200 in an advanced graduate program israel is at the forefront of the struggle against terrorism and will continue to defend its citizens who are exposed to this threat on a daily basis israels foreign ministry said in a written statement israel expects the nations of the world to support it in its war against those who murder students women and children by any means and with respect for neither place nor target president bush backed israeli leaders in a statement issued thursday saying i condemn in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attack in jerusalem that targeted innocent students at the merkaz harav yeshiva this barbaric and vicious attack on innocent civilians deserves the condemnation of every nation but libyas dabbashi compared the attack with bloodshed in the palestinian territory for us the human lives are the same we judge the incident itself dabbashi told reporters after the security council meeting when we have to condemn the killing of the israeli civilians we also have to look at whats happening in gaza jerusalem security increased  security was bolstered with thousands of additional officers across jerusalem and the rest of israel authorities said meanwhile celebratory shooting took place in gaza city after the news of the attack with hundreds chanting and clapping in the streets but palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas criticized the killings the palestinian authority condemns any attack on innocent civilians abbas office said in a written statement the shootings came just a day after us secretary of state condoleezza rice who met with both israelis and palestinians announced that peace talks will resume between the two sides abbas suspended peace negotiations last week after fierce fighting broke out between israel and palestinian militants in gaza but he agreed to resume negotiations after meeting with rice israel will continue peace talks with the palestinians regardless of the attack in jerusalem foreign ministry spokesman aryeh mekel said thursday israel conducted a largescale operation in gaza to hunt down palestinian militants who have been firing dozens of rockets into israel at least 70 palestinians and two israeli soldiers were killed during the operation israeli and palestinian sources said militants also fired at least 25 rockets toward israel wounding at least two civilians this operation came directly after the attack committed inside gaza this operation is a normal response said fawzi barhoom a hamas spokesman in gaza  watch barhooms reaction to the attack   gillerman said the security council should condemn the attack they are so so quick sometimes to criticize israel for defending itself i would like to see those members convene as we speak in order to condemn this in the strongest possible terms thursdays attack was the worst inside israel since april 17 2006 when a suicide bombing outside a falafel restaurant in tel aviv killed nine people islamic jihad claimed responsibility for that attack attacks in jerusalem are rare eight

for shooting and killing alexander hamilton in a duel in 1804 that may be true but the characters whove held the job are definitely worth a few good pages of trivia join mentalfloss in toasting seven backup plans that made this country great 1 chester arthur james garfields vp chester arthur took office under the thickest cloud of suspicion as a lieutenant in senator roscoe conklings political machine arthur held one of the most lucrative positions in government collector for the port of new york for seven years arthur raked in approximately 40000 annually about 700000 today running a corrupt spoils system for thousands of payroll employees with so much money and power arthur developed an affinity for fancy clothes and earned the nickname the gentleman boss but his luck didnt last president rutherford hayes eventually stepped in and fired him from the post even with the kickback scandal and claims that hed been born in canada which shouldve disqualified him for the vice presidency arthur still managed to get elected on james garfields 1880 ticket after garfield passed away 199 days into his presidency arthur didnt hesitate to sign the pendleton civil service reform act much to the chagrin of conkling the act revamped civil service by effectively killing the same patronage system that made arthur very very rich in cleaning up civil service arthur also cleaned up his reputation and he exited the white house a hero 2 henry wallace franklin roosevelts second vp henry wallace was a dedicated devotee of eastern mysticism while serving as us secretary of agriculture in the 1930s he allegedly sent his guru to mongolia under the pretense of collecting grasses that could withstand drought in reality wallace was diverting funds to help his guru hunt for evidence that christ had visited asia but it wasnt wallaces spiritual beliefs that landed him americas no 2 job wallace was a big franklin roosevelt fan and supported his entire platform which is why roosevelt handpicked him as his thirdterm running mate in 1940 wallace wasnt popular with the democratic party but when roosevelt made it clear he wouldnt run without him the party acquiesced as vice president wallace made many international goodwill trips most famously he traveled to the soviet union where he experienced a political transformation that resulted in him becoming an avowed soviet apologist his communist leanings did nothing for his image especially once he became secretary of commerce under president truman in 1948 wallace unsuccessfully ran for president on the progressive party ticket espousing views that sounded shockingly marxist he even described corporations as midget hitlers attempting to crush the labor class but nobody can say wallace didnt know how to own up to his mistakes in 1952 he recanted his support of the soviet union in a magazine article called where i was wrong by then however his political career was over wallace spent the rest of his life conducting agricultural experiments on his farm in new york 3 william rufus de vane king franklin pierces vp william r king was sworn into office in cuba becoming the only executive officer to take the oath on foreign soil king had gone to cuba to recuperate from tuberculosis and severe alcoholism but it didnt work he died in 1853 after being vice president for just 25 days that might not be the most memorable thing about king though its widely rumored that the former vp was homosexual further still hes suspected of being james buchanans lover neither king nor buchanan ever married and they lived together in washington for 15 years before buchanan became president of course kings predilection for wearing scarves and wigs only fanned the rumors president andrew jackson used to call him miss nancy and aaron brown a fellow southern democrat dubbed him aunt fancy 4 richard m johnson martin van burens vp despite his credentials as a war hero and a kentucky senator vice president richard m johnson was never accepted in washington perhaps thats because he dressed like a farmhand cursed like a sailor and made no secret of his three black mistresses who were also his slaves the first mistress bore him two daughters before she passed away the second tried to run off with a native american chief but johnson captured and resold her and the third was the second ones sister johnson attempted to introduce this third mistress into polite society but the couple wasnt wellreceived with the support of andrew jackson johnson landed the vice presidency under martin van buren in 1836 after four years of public relations disasters jackson withdrew his support nonetheless van buren kept johnson on his ticket and the two lost their reelection bid in 1840 5 aaron burr thomas jeffersons vp no story on vice presidents would be complete without aaron burr  best known for shooting and killing alexander hamilton in a duel in 1804 after the incident burr went back to presiding over the senate from there he plotted a treasonous conspiracy to become emperor of the western united states and mexico the plan could have worked but one of burrs coconspirators ratted him out he was tried in 1807 before the supreme court which found him not guilty mainly because he hadnt actually committed the treason yet a free man burr turned his sights on florida he went to france and tried to convince napoleon bonaparte to help him conquer the swampland but that plan foundered too although his political high jinks often failed burr consistently found success with the ladies after his wife died in 1794 burr remained a bachelor for 40 years making the acquaintance of several eligible socialites he enjoyed flirtations with philadelphia debutantes as well as a widow named dolley payne todd  later known as dolley madison wife of james madison at age 76 burr married a wealthy widow of illrepute and plundered her fortune citing numerous infidelities on his part she filed for divorce and was actually granted it unfortunately for her it came through on the day burr died 6 andrew johnson abraham lincolns 4th vp andrew johnson took his 1865 vicepresidential oath drunk as a skunk and belligerent as hell having grown up dirt poor johnson felt the aristocracy in washington had abused his kinfolk glassyeyed and smelling of whiskey he reminded congress the supreme court the cabinet and pretty much everyone within hearing distance that they owed their positions to plebeians such as himself then kissed the bible and staggered away needless to say his address was poorly received the new york world opined to think that one frail life stands between this insolent clownish creature and the presidency may god bless and spare abraham lincoln unfortunately god didnt the south surrendered six days before lincolns assassination leaving johnson to handle reconstruction  a job he bungled so completely that congress moved to impeach him incredibly johnson avoided being booted out of office by just one vote 7 john cabell breckenridge james buchanans vp by all accounts john c breckenridge was a kentucky gentleman in the grandest sense he had an impressive career as a lawyer and a representative in the kentucky house more notably at age 36 he became the youngest vice president in history but like aaron burr things took a turn for breckenridge when he was charged with treason in september 1861 only a few months after his vice presidential term had ended union and confederate forces invaded his home state of kentucky breckenridge cast his lot with the confederates and the federal government promptly indicted him breckenridge headed south and became jefferson davis secretary of war but when the confederacy surrendered in 1865 breckenridge was forced to go on the lam he hid for the next two months in georgia and florida before escaping to cuba breckinridge his wife and their children spent the next four years in exile wandering through canada england europe and the middle east until president andrew johnson issued a general amnesty proclamation on christmas in 1868 the following march breckenridge returned to the country with his family but his name

a18b463219c663ef55a0cbbf81ae489cdf877b62,new york cnn  its been five years since carrie bradshaw journeyed to paris in search of true love on the series finale of sex and the city she appeared to have found it in the arms of mr big and she returned to new york  and her nowsettled friends  ready for a new start sarah jessica parker was a driving force in creating the sex and the city movie then came the inevitable cry thats it what happens next sarah jessica parker who played carrie wanted to find out as well but the situation had to be right she said which prompted a cascade of rumors as plans for a movie came together fell apart and came together again now that the movie is out parker  whos a producer of the film as well as one of its stars  talked about the journey to making a bigscreen sex and the city with showbiz tonight anchor aj hammer the following is an edited version of that interview cnn i think a lot of fans maybe a lot of people and those of you among the cast didnt think this day would actually ever come  but here we are so how are you feeling deep inside sarah sarah jessica parker i feel extraordinarily privileged ive spent the last two years cobbling this movie together  its a onceinalifetime kind of professional experience and one really shouldnt be greedy enough to ask for it twice  watch the cast talk about the thrill of sex   i have to say that this last six eight months was better than those seven years the show aired and i think its because we all recognize how lucky and unique those seven years were and that this is a story that you dont get to tell twice it has been i must say worth every obstacle and dead end and fit and start and every moment that was seemingly impossible it has been a dream cnn and i imagine sitting down for the first time in that room together for the table read which was from my understanding the first time you all actually were in the same room together regardless of how much you kept in touch tell me a little bit about that moment parker i started putting the script back together in april of 2006  and that table read was a really extraordinary day because just the perfunctory details of getting people to a table read were complicated kim cattrall had been away and kristin davis had been away and chris noth had been doing his other job and this magnificent script had arrived and had been everything we hoped for and more it was basically like being in an alternate universe for about three hours  it was a kind of reunion that is very very special because you really want to be there its not the reunion where youre forced by your parents to meet your aunts and uncles that you see rarely its the reunion that you want i think even more so was that first day on the set when we thought good god writerdirector michael patrick king and i are actually making this movie like we got it done were here were doing it  what a privilege cnn i think we as fans and viewers actually got a sense of what that feeling was like when we saw you all together on oprah because the energy was  palpable  but were talking about the perceived drama around this whole project rumors have abounded about friction between the stars one of my producers said while we were watching the tv are they going to sit near each other why are they putting chris in the middle of all of them hearing that does it make you mad parker i find it slightly  its not that im mad i expect better from people i think its really beneath me to keep defending myself i have a 35year career i have an impeccable character i really pride myself in my work ethic and the way i treat people and i think kim would say the same and cynthia would say the same and i love kim and i wanted her to be in this movie we couldnt have done it without her we couldnt have done it without kristin we couldnt have done it without cynthia nixon nor could we have done it without chris  watch cattrall address the rumors   you know this is a story that people like to tell about women why i dont know is it that interesting probably not so once again i just have to say it doesnt define the experience nobody can take the experience away its far more interesting for me to talk about my affection for this cast than to start to deny a sad old beaten tale cnn you seem to have what goes on in the media in perspective  and you have to being at the game as long as youve been to that end one of the things that ive always admired about you and husband matthew broderick and i think a lot of people do is how youve managed your public or your private life while being in the glare of the spotlight  now i know one of the main reasons you guys are able to make it work is because you dont talk about your private lives which is great and i applaud that that said is there something that you can tell me about what it is about your relationship that enables you to make it work separate from that parker i wouldnt make any proclamations about why i have a marriage that to me is successful i would just say that weve chosen to live in a city where we are not the most interesting people this is a city that is about industry and finance and publishing and architecture and the arts and education and academia and the movie industry fits into it in some small way but there are a lot of people of important interest and i think that its a conscious choice to live in a place where were bumping up against humanity we run to the market on our own we take the subway and we integrate into our city and we become a part of the fabric and i think its really been to our benefit and certainly to our son does it mean that we are not scrutinized and that we dont have paparazzi every single day at our house no but it is a city where you cant live behind a gate you cant drive up in a car and be protected you walk out the door and it is what it is so you reconcile those things and you make the best choices you can cnn is it the end of sex and the city what does your gut tell you parker my gut tells me its up to you and your colleagues and the critics and the people who show up the future is dictated not by us at this point and i think michael patrick and i have been so focused at getting this movie up on the big screen that we havent thought about the future doing this was more than we could have asked for so anything beyond that is really kind of out of our hands in a perfectly wonderful way,"sarah jessica parker sex and the city has been a dream

the biggest hurdle of all providing a product or service for which customers are willing to pay president ulysses s grant foiled a gold scam in all likelihood it would be much easier to just stumble upon some clever scam to line your pockets or so it would seem as many aspiring scam artists quickly learn when a business scam fails it tends to fail in rather grand fashion just ask any of these four teams of notsosmooth operators a corny sea story  xenothemis and hegestratos may not have been the worlds first whitecollar criminals but they were certainly noteworthy for their incompetence in 360 bc the pair stumbled upon what seemed like a killer plan to make some quick cash shipping was extremely risky at the time and boats went down at sea with alarming frequency to exploit this uncertainty xenothemis and hegestratos devised a plan in which they would receive a cash advance to ship a load of corn from syracuse to athens due to the dangers associated with shipping the buyer would take on full risk if the shipment didnt make it to athens so if the boat sank xenothemis and hegestratos could keep their cash instead of loading the ship with expensive corn the conniving pair made a plan to sail an empty ship out to sea for a few days then sink it and escape in lifeboats since the boat itself was insured this plot seemed airtight and the potential profit was great unfortunately though the boats other passengers allegedly caught wind of the scheme during the attempting scuttling of the ship these passengers were understandably a bit peeved at hegestratos attempts to drown them for his own financial gain hegestratos panicked and jumped overboard at which point he drowned unable to sink the ship by himself xenothemis had to sail on to the port at which point the buyer protos wanted to know why his shipload of corn was empty a legal battle followed and although the verdict has been lost by history its safe to say that the late hegestratos regretted the scam when friday went black  despite his prowess as a general ulysses s grants presidency didnt go so smoothly ones of its most notable scandals occurred in 1869 when a group of speculators upended the us gold market the plan started when financier james fisk and robber baron jay gould formed a group of speculators with the goal of cornering the gold market which would give the group the ability to manipulate the price of course one can only corner the market if theres a fixed quantity of gold available otherwise the government could just sell large quantities of gold and the cornering effort would be an expensive failure in an effort to avoid this fate gould and fisk brought president grants brotherinlaw abel corbin into their fold using corbins influence to get an audience with the president the pair would argue to grant that selling gold was a terrible idea that the government should avoid at all costs the wily pair also used their influence at the white house to secure a position as assistant treasurer of the united states for daniel butterfield who would warn them if the government started to sell gold with their connections in place fisk and gould started buying up gold in september 1869 quickly driving the price of gold up by around 30 percent once grant and his advisors got wise to the situation though the government quickly sold off 4 million in gold to break the corner effectively killing the inflated prices on september 24 as investors scrambled to get rid of their overpriced gold the price plummeted sharply and many involved in the scam lost huge amounts of money fisk and gould managed to avoid big losses due to their connections in the treasury but what would be known as black friday didnt earn them a huge windfall  and significantly harmed the american economy bad moves  if youve ever hired movers you know it can be pretty pricey erik deri the founder of woodinville washingtonbased nationwide moving systems understood that most movers were expensive so he drummed up business by offering supercheap quotes to frugal clients the customers were ecstatic to find a mover who could get their belongings to a new home so cheaply that is until the price went up deris movers would load the companys vans with all of a customers worldly belongings then a foreman would inform the client that theyd have to pay an inflated price to actually get their stuff to their new digs the price hikes werent small either one mans estimate stated he could move for 3000 but was later revised to 16000 after loading according to authorities if customers balked at these demands the movers would threaten to unload their boxes and furniture into the streetand then charge them an unloading fee if things got really sticky nationwides trucks could just take off with all of the clients possessions deri supposedly paid cash bonuses to employees who successfully strongarmed customers into forking over the premiums in the end though deri learned that you cant scam that many customers and hope to get away with it in 2005 he was found guilty of 27 counts of extortion and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and

gold  brex minerals ltd was a small canadian mining company that made a big announcement in 1995 geologists had discovered gold on a site brex owned near busang indonesia not just a little gold either  at least 30 million ounces possibly as much as 200 million ounces given the high prices of gold such a deposit would have been worth tens of billions of dollars brexs stock price shot through the roof shares went from being valued at a few cents to over 280 canadian in fact the deposit seemed so rich and so large that a small company like brex could not possibly handle it all without some help in 1997 the indonesian government convinced brex to take on an american firm as a partner to help extract the gold when this firm freeportmcmoran started sampling the soil at the deposit site as part of its due diligence it reached a confusing conclusion there wasnt any gold in the soil subsequent examinations by independent auditors reached the same conclusion the natural gold that in the original samples brex had taken was mostly river gold from other regions or shavings off of gold jewelry although the companys market cap had climbed to 44 billion this report quickly destroyed brexs value share prices dropped 97 percent in a day following the announcement the company was soon removed from the toronto stock exchange and nasdaq and brex quickly went bankrupt amazingly no one ended

for me to deal with and had the potential to damage my career i think that the joke very quickly got out of hand and i think where i was at fault was that i was probably a little sensitive about it because i could actually see the potential of this sort of thing to get out of control and it did we played in a game at west ham and the terraces started singing something particularly defamatory about me and i remember being you know really really shocked that it got to that level so quickly dr and that carried on as well and the most notable incident is the one involving robbie fowler tell me about that gs it all culminated in a game that we played at stamford bridge against liverpool and robbie fowler he stood in front of 40000 people and he bent over and invited me to perform a homosexual act upon him thats the politest way i can put it that really was the point at which it couldnt get any worse it wasnt just people singing on the terrace it was a colleague  an international colleague  humiliating you in front of all those people an international audience he will maintain to this day that it was just a laugh but that is exactly the point if you look at anything like this whether it is racism or homophobia or whatever as if it is just a laugh that can be a very serious issue im all for a good laugh but when you offend someone and you are damaging relationships then it goes way beyond being a laugh and you cant hide behind that as an excuse dr its thought that only one professional soccer player in the world has ever declared himself to be gay that was the englishman justin fashanu and he committed suicide a decade ago john amaechi became the first gay player to be associated with the nba last year but such declarations are extremely rare in many cases homosexuality remains pro sports last taboo gs its such a terrible reflection on a sport that has so much positive impact across the globe that there is still this issue about gay people within the sport if you look at so many other professions in terms of business and politics across the board the gay community is represented but in football it still isnt and i find that disappointing there may not be many gay players in the game but the sport should be grown up enough to be able to support those people in the football environment dr footballs obviously made great strides certainly in britain in the last 10 years with regards to racism but how much prejudice is there generally in the game do you think well ever be free of it gs i think theres always going to be an undercurrent of prejudice but ultimately i think its important for any business really to be responsible inclusive and representative of its employees and football is in a very privileged position and can lead by example and so i hope that you know the people in authority really make some serious attempts i suppose to create parity between all walks of life dr weve come across a couple of black footballers who say that fans who shout racist abuse arent really racist they are just trying to put us off our game how much do you buy into that approach gs well i cant speak for individual black players but sometimes i think the perception of people it is not happening to is different to the individual it used to baffle me when i first started playing that youd have chelsea fans being racist to black players from the opposition but there would be three or four black players on the chelseas team and if you spoke to them or confronted them about it they would be like oh yeah but we know them they are you know they are fine and its like well how do you pick the bones out of that because there is just no logic but then you know prejudice is built on ignorance you know it really is i think that sometimes you know individuals have to take responsibility for themselves and actually take a step back and look at what they are doing and not use ignorance as an excuse and say well would i like to be on the receiving end of this sort of abuse,"graeme le saux says an undercurrent of prejudice exists in football

46210bd0b15cd5bba64751d873674766decb2677,washington cnn  former terrorist suspects detained by the united states were tortured according to medical examinations detailed in a report released wednesday by a human rights group a us serviceman with his dog watches a detainee at abu ghraib prison in iraq in 2003 the massachusettsbased physicians for human rights reached that conclusion after twoday clinical evaluations of 11 former detainees who had been held at the abu ghraib prison in iraq at guantanamo bay cuba and in afghanistan the detainees were never charged with crimes we found clear physical and psychological evidence of torture and abuse often causing lasting suffering said dr allen keller a medical evaluator for the study in a 121page report the doctors group said that it uncovered medical evidence of torture including beatings electric shock sleep deprivation sexual humiliation sodomy and scores of other abuses the report is prefaced by retired us major gen antonio taguba who led the armys investigation into the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in 2003  watch why a rights group says theres evidence of torture   there is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes taguba says the only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held to account over the years reports of abuses at abu ghraib and allegations of torture at guantanamo prompted the bush administration to deny that the us military tortures detainees since only 11 detainees were examined the findings of this assessment cannot be generalized to the treatment of all detainees in us custody the report says however the incidents documented are consistent with findings of other investigations into government treatment making it reasonable to conclude that these detainees were not the only ones abused but are representative of a much larger number of detainees subjected to torture and ill treatment while in us custody four of the men evaluated were arrested in or taken to afghanistan between late 2001 and early 2003 and later were sent to guantanamo bay where they were held for an average of three years before being released without charge the report says the other seven were detained in iraq in 2003 and released within a year the report says all the subjects told examiners that they were subjected to multiple forms of torture or ill treatment that often occurred in combination over a long period of time the report says while the report presents synopses of the detainees backgrounds based on interviews with them the authors did not have access to the detainees medical histories therefore theres no way to know whether any of the inmates may have had medical or mental problems before being detained among the exdetainees was an iraqi in his mid40s identified only as laith whom us soldiers took into custody in october 2003 and who was released from abu ghraib in june 2004 according to the report laith was subjected to sleep deprivation electric shocks and threats of sexual abuse to himself and his family they took off even my underwear they asked me to do some movements that make me look in a very bad way so they can take photographs  they were trying to make me look like an animal laith told examiners according to the report according to the report laith said the most painful experiences involved threats to his family and they asked me have you ever heard voices of women in this prison i answered yes they were saying then you will hear your mothers and sisters when we are raping them  the examiners concluded in the report that laith appears to have suffered severe and lasting physical and psychological injuries as a result of his arrest and incarceration at abu ghraib prison another detainee youssef was detained by us soldiers nearly seven years ago when he tried to enter afghanistan from neighboring pakistan without a passport the report says he initially was held in an afghan prison where he describes being stripped naked being intimidated by dogs being hooded and being thrown against the wall on repeated occasions the report says a few months later he was taken to the guantanamo bay facility where he was subjected to interrogators who would enter his cell and force him to lie on the floor with his hands tied behind his back to his feet the report says youssef said the interrogators wanted him to confess of involvement with the taliban the report says based on its investigation the report calls on the us government to issue a formal apology to detainees subject to torture and ill treatment by the military since fall 2001 in afghanistan iraq guantanamo bay and elsewhere the rights group also demands that the bush administration   repudiate all forms of torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment   establish an independent commission to investigate and report publicly the circumstances of detention and interrogation at usrun prisons in

becker says this weapon exists but you already have it he calls it the gift of fear one chapter in gavins book the gift of fear has stuck with oprah since she first read it the story of a woman named kelly begins with a simple warning sign a man offers to help carry her groceries into her apartment  and instantly kelly doesnt like the sound of his voice kelly goes against her gut and lets him help her  and in doing so she lets a rapist into her home we get a signal prior to violence gavin says there are preincident indicators things that happen before violence occurs gavin says that unlike any other living creature humans will sense danger yet still walk right into it youre in a hallway waiting for an elevator late at night elevator door opens and theres a guy inside and he makes you afraid you dont know why you dont know what it is some memory of this building  whatever it may be and many women will stand there and look at that guy and say oh i dont want to think like that i dont want to be the kind of person who lets the door close in his face ive got to be nice i dont want him to think im not nice and so human beings will get into a steel soundproof chamber with someone theyre afraid of and theres not another animal in nature that would even consider it for weeks nicole had a funny feeling that something odd was going on in her apartment my gut started feeling like something just wasnt right she says i would come home and there would be just weird lights on in my house  lights that i didnt even remember turning on in the first place then one day nicole noticed a ups delivery box where it shouldnt be im like how did this brand of box get on my back balcony nicole began to feel uneasy  but continued to brush it off i would just come home you know and almost feel nauseous she says i kept trying to justify it saying okay it is in my head nicoles funny feeling eventually escalated into fullfledged panic attacks which gavin says were her intuitions way of telling her that something was wrong and intuition records everything so when she started getting panics attacks her intuition is saying basically youre not going to listen okay ill ramp it up ill give you panic attacks you want sleepless nights ill give you sleepless nights nicole eventually did listen to her intuition starting with a simple test i dropped a tank top behind the door as i was leaving for work thinking that when i come home that night im going to peek my head around the corner if the tank top had been pushed to the side it would have been obvious that the door was opened when nicole got home she says the tank top had moved caught on camera  the next day nicole says she set up a hidden camera to try and find out what was going on in her apartment once she came home nicole says she plugged the camcorder into her laptop and the first thing i see is this mans head peeking around the corner into my house she says what i felt at that point was just complete terror im sitting there watching this video this story unfold  and this person comes in my house is looking around going through my things looking through my laundry holding up my lingerie as nicole continues to watch in horror the intruder undresses himself and puts her lingerie on so this person is in my clothes proceeds to start pleasuring himself  just very very graphic things happening right there in my house with my belongings and he finishes up takes off my clothes  and puts them exactly back as i had left them  puts his clothes back on checks to make sure nobodys outside the door and leaves after watching the tape nicole says she ran around her apartment screaming hysterically she says she had never seen the man in the tape before initially i took my cell phone called my boyfriend at the time screaming hysterically all i could say was hes in my house hes in my house even picking up the phone dialing was difficult two weeks later police found the man  39yearold shawn rogers a computer consultant with a young son and a wife at the time police were unable to charge rogers with anything more than trespassing  until he came back to nicoles apartment to steal her camera police were able to charge rogers with burglary and he was sentenced to eight years in prison dangerous behavior  when nicole found the ups box on her balcony gavin says this was a warning sign gavin applauds nicole for listening to her intuition and says that quieting her fear could have caused the situation to escalate hes already into behavior of wanting to get caught he says you dont come back again and again and again and not want to get caught gavin says like nicole the intruders intuition was probably trying to tell him something too offenders as well can see whats happening in their lives and talk about not listening to it  hes in someones apartment doing something sexual with their clothes on  thats something to listen to because the intruder had a job and a family gavin says his behavior was not only reckless but dangerous as well when people do listen they can stop whats almost fate gavin says theres a great line that carl jung said he said what we do not make conscious emerges later as fate if he made it conscious if he could talk to someone about it if he could tell someone he could get better also but he didnt and it does mean escalation if she discovered him thats dangerous if he came in when she was there thats dangerous your feelings are warnings  doris who says she endured years of sexual abuse at the hands of her husband appeared on the oprah show after leaving her husband unfortunately her battle didnt end there  two months after she left him doriss exhusband abducted her at gunpoint and raped her after the show oprah spoke with doris again to ask if her she had sensed any warning signs the night she was abducted as i was coming home from work it was just a very eerie strange feeling as i drove up doris says it was darker than normal in my driveway and there was a trash can sitting where i normally park right in the middle i thought hmm this is strange because my mother lives with me and shell turn on the lights when it gets dark it did give me a little eerie feeling  the hairs on the back of your neck kind of stand up but still i didnt listen to my instincts gavin says that eerie feeling is exactly what he wants women to pay attention to were trying to analyze the warning signs he says and what i really want to teach today and forever is the feeling is the warning sign all the other stuff is our explanation for the feeling why it was this why it was

region for over 15 years he reports from gaza on daily life and reality over the past year in this fractious land cnns ben wedeman reports on the past year in gaza where people are safer but out of food gas and patience gaza city gaza cnn   if you take pictures ill kill you ill kill you screamed a masked fatah gunman pointing his ak47 assault rifle at my cameraman joe duran calm down calm down i shouted back at him turning to joe to tell him to put the camera down joe and i had ducked into a fruit and vegetable shop in gaza city we had been covering the funeral of a fatah gunman killed in a clash with hamas rivals when our third gunbattle of the day had broken out the gunman left much to everyones relief and i put my small video camera on the floor and pressed the button to record the constant roar of machine gun fire which went on for more than half an hour earlier in the day joe and i were on a street corner videotaping hamas militiamen when a jeep full of fatah irregulars opened fire just down the street from an elementary school as guns blazed schoolchildren ran for cover i watched as shopkeeper khadar aliyan slammed shut the doors of his grocery store the expression on his face one of fear and utter exasperation im going home he told me im afraid were done for its never been this bad it was violence like this which we witnessed on december 2006 that reached a climax in the second week of june 2007 when it ended on june 14 2007 with hamas roundly defeating fatah gaza went quiet and quiet  relative quiet that is  has been hamas biggest accomplishment since no longer do you worry about being kidnapped gunbattles though they can happen are much less common after last junes takeover or coup detat as fatah supporters call it hamas quickly imposed law and order tried to reacquaint gazas drivers with longforgotten traffic regulations launched a municipal cleanup campaign and forced the release of kidnapped bbc journalist alan johnston who had been held in captivity for almost six months chaosweary gazans applauded all of these initiatives but the honeymoon ended quickly as reality sank in since hamas won parliamentary elections in january 2006 and even more so since last years takeover israel has tightened its siege of gaza israel has restricted supplies of gasoline diesel and electricity to gaza limited the amount of food and other goods entering the strip and made it virtually impossible for manufacturers and farmers in gaza to export anything to the outside world israeli officials say these measures are intended to pressure hamas which is on the us government list of terrorist groups to stop its members and other factions from firing mortars and rockets into israel israel defense forces reports that 1500 qassam rockets were fired into israel from gaza in 2007 and 2383 in the past six years as a result almost all of gazas factories have shut down and thousands of workers have lost their jobs between 70 and 80 percent of the population is dependent on food supplied by the united nations refugee works agency set up after more than 700000 palestinians became refugees after the war that resulted in israels creation in 1948 life in gaza never easy in the last year has become a grinding daily struggle to make ends meet for the vast majority of gazans it means they must spend much of their time trying to secure basic commodities such as cooking gas which comes from israel in the past when supplies were plentiful it was sold from the back of trucks and donkey carts not anymore when there are supplies people flock to a few distribution centers one is a hot crowded compound north of gaza city where the stench of gas is so strong you shudder with fear that someone will light a cigarette and the whole place will go up in flames people have to wait for their cooking gas for hours some claim days in the hot sun there i met a woman who identified herself as um wadia the mother of wadia who at 2 pm told me she had been waiting since 5 am she said she had run out of cooking gas three days before typical of so many people here she blamed both main palestinian factions for her woes hamas hasnt done anything for us nor has fatah she said all those people want is to sit comfortably on their thrones in gaza city long lines of immobile cars and trucks wind around the block from gas stations their owners waiting surprisingly patiently for supplies to arrive the only other option is to go in search of black market gasoline much of it smuggled through tunnels from egypt it goes for more than 10 a liter which comes close to almost 50 a gallon it is now common for families to divide up responsibilities for the day one family member will go in search of cooking gas another will join the line for gasoline or diesel another for whatever else is in short supply to get around the shortages some motorists mix their fuel with cooking oil a practice that isnt particularly good for the motor many people complain that its unhealthy  but it works others like electrical engineer wasim khazandar are thinking completely outside the box wasim has invented an electric car which he is more than happy to show off hes already received dozens of orders from motorists weary of the search for fuel beyond material concerns there are worries here that hamas has a barely concealed hardline islamist agenda and one often hears complaints that the group is intolerant of any form of dissent or criticism one man who can testify to that is ibrahim abu alnaja the most senior fatah leader to remain in gaza after most fled to safety in ramallah abu alnaja is from the fatah old school a grizzled veteran of the groups wars in lebanon he told me earlier this year hamas security officials showed up at his home late at night bound his hands put a blindfold on him and dragged him to their headquarters where they shaved his head and cut off his moustache then released him without apology or explanation he makes no excuses for fatahs dismal track record of corruption and mismanagement when it ran gaza but says the crisis that began with hamas rise to power is nothing short of a catastrophe our people has been transformed he said into a desperate people who must search for food for the minimum of survival its as if we returned to 1948 dependent on gifts and assistance and relief despite all the difficulties of life under hamas despite all the grumbling the men who run gaza are as confident today as they were a year ago that they will weather the crisis and emerge stronger last wednesday i went to see ahmed yusif a senior adviser to hamas prime minister ismail haniya whatever the israelis think said the useducated yusif whatever pressure they put on us its not going to make us buckle or give concessions this is part of the palestinian struggle for more than 60 years living in the refugee camps he said we dont always enjoy a good life its the toughness and the suffering that are part of the struggle others here dont quite see it that way like a man i met in gazas old market who would only identify himself as abu khalid i asked him if he was better off today than a year ago he laughed

handover of the 60page declaration document  and fridays expected destruction of the cooling tower at yongbyon  president bush ordered some sanctions against north korea lifted and instructed the state department to remove the reclusive communist nation from us lists of enemies and nations that support terrorism but as important as what the document says is what it doesnt say there is no mention of how many weapons north korea has or where they are hidden nor did north korea admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with syria both issues are reduced in the declaration to concerns pyongyang promises to address down the road bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice have pledged a robust verification process to doublecheck north koreas claims and north korea has promised to allow us inspectors access to the yongbyon facility and to interview its nuclear experts but it is far from clear whether pyongyang will allow the kind of intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear arsenal that the united states will need to get a complete picture of north koreas program congressional republicans not so sure about pyongyang  the stiffest opposition to the deal is coming from conservative republicans once considered president bushs strongest allies in confronting north koreas nuclear ambition they feel that the bush administration has let north korea off the hook especially when it comes to its enriched uranium program and suspected proliferation to syria rep ileana roslehtinen rflorida the top republican on the foreign affairs committee expressed profound disappointment over bushs announcement that north korea would be coming off the lists of enemies and state sponsors of terrorism and rep pete hoekstra rmichigan the top republican on the permanent select committee on intelligence accused president bush of sacrificing its principles for a foreign policy success a decision seemingly has been made that it is more important for the white house to reach a legacy agreement than to get to the bottom of north koreas nuclear efforts hoekstra said lifting sanctions and removing north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism flies in the face of history and rewards its brutal dictator for shallow gestures rep ed royce rcalifornia called north koreas declaration late and incomplete alleging that north korea built a nuclear facility for syria considered a terrorist state by the united states while the nuclear negotiations were ongoing that he said was proof that pyongyang cant be trusted how do you have a meaningful declaration of your nuclear program without saying how many bombs you have royce asked this is a signal to other proliferating regimes that nuclear weapons will be rewarded without ever having to give them up democrats who once criticized bush for not talking directly to north korea about its nuclear program are cautiously supportive of the deal howard berman the democratic chairman of the house foreign affairs committee called the norths submission of a declaration encouraging even former presidential candidate sen john kerry dmassachusetts praised the bush administration saying engaging our enemies can pay dividends but kerry added historians will long wonder why this administration did not directly engage north korea before pyongyang gathered enough material for several nuclear weapons tested a nuclear device and the missiles to deliver them are we headed down the same road with iran in his 2002 state of the union address bush termed iraq north korea and iran the axis of evil saying they were arming to threaten the peace of the world fourteen months after delivering that speech  and after dictator saddam hussein released a 12000page declaration that it had no weapons of mass destruction  us forces invaded iraq but no such program was found nor were stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction more than five years into the war the united states is still battling al qaeda and iraqi insurgents there sixparty talks with north korea began in 2003 after north korea withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty progress was limited until 2007 when north korea agreed to shut down yongbyon and allow international monitors back into the country for monitoring and verification progress has been even more limited for the third member of the axis of evil iran the bush administration has joined the other members of the un security council  britain france china and russia along with germany  in offering iran a set of political and economic incentives similar to the ones north korea was given in exchange for suspending its uranium enrichment program but the united states has refused to sit down with iran until that suspension takes place the un security council has passed three resolutions imposing sanctions against iran and the united states has worked with some success to isolate iran from the international financial community but unlike north korea which is isolated and desperately in need of international aid iran is rich in oil and a powerful force in the middle east and its only getting richer and more immune to sanctions as oil prices skyrocket and iran seems to be running out the clock and waiting to try its luck with a new us president sen barack obama the presumptive democratic nominee has pledged to engage iran in direct talks to try to curb its nuclear ambitions sen john mccain the presumptive gop nominee has taken a much tougher line refusing to rule out military action to prevent a nucleararmed iran with the coming change in the us administration us officials diplomats and other iran experts believe that it would be at least eight months to a year before the united states and iran could seriously think about talking meanwhile by its own admission iran continues to perfect its nuclear technology if the north korean experience can serve as a lesson for the next us president that lesson may well be that the longer the united states waits to talk to iran the higher the cost will be to get tehran out of the nuclear business,"just as important as what the nuclear declaration says is what it doesnt say 
north korea didnt admit to uranium enrichment or sharing secrets with syria 
many republicans say bush administration has let pyongyang off the hook 
us may be headed down the same road with iran ",The bush administration hailed north koreas declaration of its nuclear program as a success for the multilateral diplomacy it engaged in through the six party talks with south korea china japan and russia. There is no mention of how many weapons north korea has or where they are hidden nor did north k Korea admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with syria.

to be one of my key partners in making sure that were moving forward on issues like healthcare that she cares so deeply about at an event in riverside california sen john mccain the presumptive republican presidential nominee said clinton is probably returning to the senate with greater political clout i think if i had to guess that the fact that the she ran an honorable and incredibly long and dedicated campaign for the nomination of her party would indicate to me that she would probably return to the united states senate with enhanced prestige and enhanced influence mccain said he also praised clinton for her work on military matters since joining the legislative body in 2001 i think that sen clinton has already attained a position of leadership in the united states senate he said she works hard at her job she is a very important member of the armed services committee and i have worked together with her on a variety of national security issues mccain is working hard to persuade

is running for president sen barack obamas speech on patriotism comes days before the fourth of july at certain times over the last 16 months i have found for the first time my patriotism challenged  at times as a result of my own carelessness more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears and doubts about who i am and what i stand for he said in president harry trumans hometown just days before the fourth of july obama vowed to never question the patriotism of others in the campaign adding i will not stand idly by when i hear others question mine obama has been defending his patriotism ever since the beginning of the primary season when he was first criticized for not wearing a flag pin  which he now does much more frequently  and when false rumors began circulating that he did not say the pledge of allegiance  watch excerpts of obamas speech   a widely distributed photo also seemed to show him failing to place his hand over his heart during a rendition of the starspangled banner obamas wife michelle also was criticized about her patriotism after telling an audience at a campaign event for the first time in my adult lifetime im really proud of my country obamas campaign said she was just excited about the campaigns grassroots support but her words still provided fodder for her husbands opponents at his appearance monday barack obama appealed to unity given the enormous challenges that lie before us we can no longer afford these sorts of divisions he said none of us expect that arguments about patriotism will or should vanish entirely after all when we argue about patriotism we are arguing about who we are as a country and more importantly who we should be but surely we can agree that no party or political philosophy has a monopoly on patriotism and surely we can arrive at a definition of patriotism that however rough and imperfect captures the best of americas common spirit obama said that for him patriotism starts as a gut instinct a loyalty and love for country thats rooted in some of my earliest memories obama described how as he grew up his patriotism matured to something that would survive my growing awareness of our nations imperfections its ongoing racial strife the perversion of our political system that were laid bare during the watergate hearings the wrenching poverty of the mississippi delta and the hills of appalachia obama said he learned that what makes america great has never been its perfection but the belief that it can be made better patriotism he said must involve the willingness to sacrifice he called attention to the service of john mccain the presumptive republican candidate mccains campaign has been calling on obama to condemn comments from retired gen wesley clark who said this weekend that mccains service in vietnam did not necessarily mean that he was qualified to serve as commanderinchief read about what clark said  clark is a military adviser for obama in his speech monday obama did not directly address clarks comments but after calling attention to mccains service he said no one should ever devalue that service especially for the sake of a political campaign and that goes for supporters of both sides we must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform period he said just as obama was finishing his speech his campaign released a statement about clarks remarks as hes said many times before sen obama honors and respects sen mccains service and of course he rejects yesterdays statement by gen clark obama campaign spokesman bill burton said meanwhile mccains campaign announced monday it was launching a new truth squad to defend the arizona senators military record leaders of the latest group include mccains fellow vietnam prisoners of war air force col bud day and marine lt col orson swindle along with former navy pilot carl smith who served with him mccain said monday he was proud of his record of service  watch mccains response to clarks comments   the important thing is that if thats the kind of campaign that sen obama and his surrogates and his supporters want to engage in i understand that he said but it doesnt reduce the price of a gallon of gas by one penny it doesnt achieve our energy independence or make it come any closer  and it certainly doesnt do anything to address the challenges that americans have in keeping their jobs their homes and supporting their families obama was to follow up mondays speech on patriotism with an address tuesday about faith and remarks later in the week on service he will spend his fourth of july in butte montana campaigning with his family mccain on monday was campaigning in pennsylvania a battleground state in the general election he was scheduled to speak with reporters in harrisburg before holding a town hall meeting in pipersville mccain leaves for colombia on tuesday and will travel to mexico later in the week his campaign on

28 days after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate with the militarybacked caretaker government on organizing the elections police told cnn that by saturday 16916 arrests had been made while local media reported another 1548 were arrested sunday the awami league and the bangladesh nationalist party bnp said hundreds of their party members had been taken into custody the timing and targets of the arrests are a dead giveaway they are politically motivated brad adams of the new yorkbased human rights watch said in a statement its obvious that they are paying the price for the political parties refusal to accept the governments conditions to participate in the elections the government rejects the allegations the detentions it said are part of a planned sweep to rid the country of criminals our igp inspector general of police or chief of police categorically said this special drive was being conducted to create a congenial atmosphere before the general election said kamrul ahsan a spokesman for bangladesh police it is not politically motivated he said the intention is not to harass anybody politically the crackdown began after the awami league and the bnp said they would not cooperate with the government to develop a roadmap toward democracy unless it first releases the parties leaders the two women who head the parties  sheikh hasina of the awami league and khaleda zia of the bnp  are in police custody on corruptionrelated charges hasina is charged with bribetaking zia is being held on charges of graft for improperly awarding a multimillion dollar government contract the current political crisis in the muslimmajority south asian country of 150 million can be traced in large part to the lingering animosity between the two women political observers say their rivalry runs so deep that the women are known in the country as the battling begums begum is an honorific given to women of rank in the country since the countrys independence in 1972 the awami league or the bnp has ruled bangladesh for all but eight years both women have served as prime minister at one point or another after its last stint in power ended in 2006 the bnp handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections as mandated by the countrys constitution but the awami league refused to recognize the neutrality of the interim government hasina accused zia of stocking it with bnp backers supporters and party members took to the streets in months of deadly clashes to stem the tide of violence a militarybacked government took control in january 2007 and imposed an indefinite state of emergency it also postponed elections until it said it could clean up the countrys graftridden politics the caretaker government adopted the emergency powers rules the rules allowed authorities to arrest people without a warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime human rights watch said a wave of detentions followed by some estimates more than 90000 people were detained before some were released and others charged with crimes among those arrested were more than 150 top politicians including hasina and zia  leading to the current political stalemate the government wants to hold elections in the third week of december and said the crusade on crime is part of its plan to ensure troublefree balloting the political parties allege the arrests are intended to pave the way for the election of progovernment candidates they want their leaders set free before they sit down and talk with the government about a roadmap toward a successful election they also threatened to organize mass movements to secure their leaders release its kind of an impasse said taleya rehman founder and executive director of the bangladeshbased nonprofit democracy watch the government is conducting political dialogue with small parties but they are of no significance they need the two major parties on monday the government announced it was releasing hasina from custody on medical grounds so she can go abroad for treatment a similar release for zia was also expected party members say the governments move is a ploy to sideline the pair from the elections by sending them out of the country hasina has a damaged ear resulting from a bombing attack that targeted her four years ago zia is believed to have arthritis meanwhile the detentions continue  almost 1800 a day in addition to political party members the crackdown has also swept up several journalists that actually makes the arrests suspicious in some peoples minds said sultana kamal executive director of the legal aid group ain o salish kendro law and adjudication center if you just arrest any tom dick and harry saying this person may have

in august 1969 according to historical accounts of the murder atkins stabbed tate who was eight months pregnant and scrawled the word pig in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with

down the death penalty laws as they were written at the time california gov arnold schwarzenegger said tuesday he was also opposed to releasing atkins i dont believe in compassionate release the

completely unthinkable sen hillary clinton says her supporters urge her to stay in the race until it is over her campaign also accused the rival obama campaign of inflaming the situation and purposely taking her words out of context but the obama campaign said it was not trying to stir the issue up in an editorial in the new york daily news the democratic presidential hopeful also acknowledged her dwindling chances of winning the nomination saying she is aware of the odds against her headlined hillary why i continue to run the editorial began with an explanation of her reference to the assassination when she was speaking to the argus leader newspaper in south dakota she said she was pointing out that presidential primary campaigns have continued into june almost immediately some took my comments entirely out of context and interpreted them to mean something completely different  and completely unthinkable she wrote  watch hillarys camp insist the remark had nothing to do with obama   clinton said the newspapers editor and bobby kennedy jr issued statements arguing that was the meaning of her remark no other member of the kennedy family has issued a public statement on the matter i realize that any reference to that traumatic moment for our nation can be deeply painful  particularly for members of the kennedy family who have been in my heart and prayers over this past week she said in a reference to sen edward kennedys diagnosis with brain cancer and i expressed regret right away for any pain i caused but i was deeply dismayed and disturbed that my comment would be construed in a way that flies in the face of everything i stand for  and everything i am fighting for in this election some people  particularly a number of bloggers  have suggested she was imagining the possibility that sen barack obama the likely nominee could be assassinated after clintons initial remarks to the newspaper were reported the obama campaign issued a statement saying the comment was unfortunate and has no place in this campaign but obama himself later said i dont think that senator clinton intended anything by it and that we should put it behind us clinton campaign chairman terry mcauliffe in an interview sunday criticized the obama campaigns first move its unfortunate  a hypedup press over memorial day weekend the obama campaign inflaming it tried to take these words out of context he told fox news sunday asked about the remark by obama himself mcauliffe responded thats great but friday they were all part of this process the press secretary came out and attacked senator clinton and got it going so the story would be around for three days howard wolfson a clinton adviser told cbs face the nation that the obama campaigns first statement critical of clinton was unfortunate but obamas chief strategist david axelrod told abcs this week that we take her at her word and he added were beyond that issue now so certainly were not trying to stir the issue up the programs host george stephanopoulos noted that a member of obamas staff sent to the media saturday a searing commentary by msnbcs keith olbermann slamming clinton for her remark mr olbermann did his commentary and he had his opinion axelrod responded adding as far as were concerned this issue is done on another front axelrod slammed clinton for suggesting she leads obama in the popular vote clinton has been making that argument based on figures that include florida and michigan even though obama took his name off the ballot in michigan and neither candidate campaigned in florida the democratic party discounted both states primaries before they took place it would take some very tortured math and tortured logic to say that shes ahead in the popular vote axelrod told abc he added this isnt american idol ok this is a nominating process we have rules we elect delegates state by state in her column clinton said she believes she can still win on the merits i am not unaware of the challenges or the odds of my securing the nomination  but this race remains extraordinarily close and hundreds of thousands of people in upcoming primaries are still waiting to vote she wrote she added that her parents did not raise me to be a quitter  and too many people still come up to me at my events grip my arm and urge me not to walk away before this contest is over she also said she is running because i believe staying in this race will help unite the democratic party i believe that if senator obama and i both make our case  and all democrats have the chance to make their voices heard  in the end everyone will be more likely to rally around the nominee she repeated her vow to campaign for obama if he gets the nomination and wrote no matter what happens in this primary i am committed to unifying this party obama was in middleton connecticut where he was standing in for the ailing edward kennedy who was scheduled to deliver the commencement at wesleyan university  watch obama tell graduates they have an obligation   the theme of obamas speech was service and the senator asked graduates to volunteer their time at home and abroad to fight poverty preserve peace and protect the environment  but i hope youll remember during those times of doubt and frustration that there is nothing naive about your impulse to change this world he said because all it takes is one act of service  one blow against injustice  to send forth that tiny ripple of hope that robert kennedy spoke of,"barack obama denounces remark then says to put it behind us

communist nation in desperate economic straits has long been willing to drop its program for better relations with the united states but mistakes on both sides interfered according to jim walsh a national security analyst north korea could be trying to achieve survival through deceit intending to keep its nuclear weapons as blackmail for better treatment analysts suggest but those making a case for north koreas sincerity walsh said would say it must do the things economically that it needs to do to avoid collapse having nuclear weapons when the regime is collapsing wont do them much good said walsh a research associate at the massachusetts institute of technology north korea following a 2007 agreement with five nations including the us handed over a declaration of its nuclear program on thursday the nation also took steps to disable a reactor that officials acknowledge helped extract plutonium to build nuclear weapons on friday it destroyed the reactors cooling tower  significant because the tower would take a year or longer to rebuild  watch the tower being demolished   after north koreas declaration president bush said thursday that he intends to move north korea from the us list of states that sponsor terrorism down the line north korea would receive economic and energy assistance if the us and other nations agree it is complying with other efforts to dismantle its nuclear program north korea has been heavily sanctioned in the past because of its nuclear program stephen hadley the us national security adviser told reporters thursday that the terror list was one incentive for north korea to drop its nuclear ambitions i think it is important to them not to be on a list that says enemies and not to be on a list that says supporters of terror hadley said walsh said north korea has been weakened by sanctions and its lack of arable land leading to a population unable to feed itself it cant grow enough food walsh said and theyve got to attract foreign investors he said north korea was better off in the days of the soviet union when it had an ample amount of communist nations with which to trade but the soviet union collapsed and many other nations turned away from communism leaving north korea increasingly isolated geostrategically north korea was growing weaker and everyone around them was growing stronger walsh said in 1994 north korea pledged to the us that it would freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for international aid including help building two powerproducing nuclear reactors by 2000 however north korea was complaining that not all the aid was coming as promised in 2002 the us accused north korea of working on a secret nuclear weapons program and the us said north korea admitted doing so countries including the us halted oil supplies and north korea withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty it conducted an underground test of a nuclear weapon in 2006 walsh said both sides havent fully lived up to previous agreements the us he said promised normalized trade at one point but didnt follow through jon wolfsthal senior fellow of the center for strategic and international studies international security program said north korea has been remarkably consistent regarding its reactions to us positions when weve engaged them directly they have responded and when we have reduced our commitment to our engagement  they have responded negatively wolfsthal said wolfsthal said china  which provides oil and food aid to north korea  has been instrumental in getting north korea to cooperate china has gone from being an uninvested  mediator to being a true participant in this process  from a country that originally wanted to help the us and north korea work out their differences to a state that has worked to convince north korea to meet its obligations wolfsthal said wolfsthal said he believes china was embarrassed by north koreas nuclear test and shifted course i think that over time the united states has helped china see that north koreas unpredictable behavior destabilizes their own backyard he said walsh and wolfsthal said another theory has it that north korea is only playing with negotiators and intends to keep its nuclear program and weapons as a security blanket expanding on that possibility wolfsthal said north korea leader kim jong il could keep the countrys nuclear arsenal but agree not to produce any more nuclear weapons everybodys speculating none of us has met kim jong il wolfsthal said walsh said the west doesnt have hard evidence to determine north koreas intentions but so far the evidence is pretty strongly on the side of north korea wanting a real bargain walsh said,"north koreas negotiations driven by economic need desire for

higher in some places drivers and smallbusiness owners are finding it hard to cope but which states motorists get the best deal and in which states do drivers pay the most to fillup here come the numbers  alaska has the highest gas prices in the nation with a gallon of regular gasoline at 4623 followed by california at 4583 as of june 30 hawaii connecticut and washington make up the top five states with highest prices with new york and dc not far behind at 4292 and 4160 respectively best states to buy gas missouri comes out top at 3862 for a gallon of regular followed by oklahoma at 3866 south carolina mississippi and arkansas iowa kansas and alabama are next in line aol autos cars with 30 mpg for 300 or less per month  past prices  we use the term best states to buy gas with this caveat back in june 2004 gas hovered at around 174 a gallon according to figures from gasbuddycom geoff sundstrom aaas fuel price analyst said the primary reasons for rising fuel prices are an increase in demand for petroleum products across the globe and a need for investment in refining infrastructure right now it is almost impossible to know where oil and gas prices will be in six months to a year he said its easy to assume that the world economy will continue to grow we are very clearly at risk of an economic downturn and perhaps a severe economic downturn which could influence the demand side to the point where oil and gas prices may drop in 10 to 20 years out oil and gasoline will continue to be more expensive but given whats happening in the markets right now there is some potential that the demands side of the equation could fall off a cliff aol autos consumer reports on best fuelefficient used cars  why so expensive in california marie montgomery spokeswoman for the automobile club of southern california says the primary reason behind the high price of gas in california is market segmentation a marketing term that basically means california along with many other states has developed a boutique blend of fuel in a bid to uphold environmental or ecological standards in californias case this blend helps clear the states notorious smog we cant use gas they made for iowa we use a special blend with additives in it an ethanol mix montgomery said when you do that you can only use refineries that make that gas mix the refineries in california are a major supplier but when prices are high and theres not another supplier we have to go where they make that mix she pointed out that refineries in oregon and washington produce the gas product and there is a pipeline to alaska but that the only other options are shipping in the blend from elsewhere in the nation or asia which is not costefficient people have to figure out how to deal with this on a longterm basis weve been telling motorists to carpool and here we are in summer and prices have barely come down she said usually were about a month into a downturn its cyclical prices go up in spring and spike in may which isnt happening this year prices may not come down a lot less misery in missouri  michael right vice president of public affairs for aaa missouri said his state is usually among the top three in terms of low gas prices a contributing factor he said is that the states pergallon tax rate is the lowest in the nation he said that most if not all states impose a tax on gasoline but few are as low as the 17 cents a gallon missouri levies and missouri unlike most other states doesnt impose a sales tax on top of that the state also benefits from good distribution via a crisscrossing network of pipelines which can unusually result in cheaper gas in rural areas than in major cities the reason for this is the three types of gas used in the state st louis primarily uses reformulated gasoline conventional gas is sold in rural areas and kansas city uses low rvp or lowemission gasoline reformulated costs more than conventional gas hence the higher cost in cities in illinois its not unusual to save 15 cents a gallon by crossing the river right said aol autos best hybrid suvs  effects on station owners and operators  while the effects of soaring pump prices on consumers are well documented owners and operators of service stations nationwide are also feeling the pain acutely dennis decota the executive director of the 135yearold california service station and automotive repair association and owner of a service station in marin county california said high prices are extremely detrimental to business people what it does is creates a financial hardship on customers leading to less foot traffic to stores or repair facilities it puts a strain on entire businesses unbranded service stations are really at the end of their rope independent unbranded stations have one retail philosophy offer the best price they rely on oversupply by refineries which they buy at wholesale prices and sell cheaper than the branded competition like shell or exxon

attacks on sen barack obamas foreign policy credentials sen john mccain says russias entry into the wto should be reviewed in response obamas top foreign policy aide suggested that the presumptive republican presidential nominee was willing to shoot from the hip and was acting irresponsibly by offering strong support for the georgia government on wednesday mccain continued his tough line against russia saying its potential membership in the world trade organization should be reviewed as a result of its actions in georgia as well its relationship with the g8 nations which represent the worlds largest industrial economies mccain also said that an international peacekeeping mission should be sent to georgia and that nato should reconsider adding georgia and ukraine another former soviet republic to the alliance  watch mccain call georgias position perilous   after the events of the past six days no one should wonder why countries on russias periphery so ardently seek the security guarantees alliance membership represents mccain said during a campaign stop in birmingham michigan russia has strenuously objected to both nations joining nato after president bush said wednesday that he was ordering the us military to help georgias citizens obama applauded the move the situation is still unstable and russia must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words obama said in a statement the united states should now join our european partners in direct highlevel diplomacy with both georgia and russia to seek immediate implementation of a ceasefire and to achieve a lasting resolution to this crisis the crisis in georgia started friday when russia moved troops in into south ossetia after the georgian government moved troops into breakaway territory south ossetia has been largely autonomous since 1991 but separatists would like to break with georgia and either declare independence or join

conflict  watch president bush declare americas unwavering support for georgia   when the crisis began last week mccain the presumptive republican presidential nominee was out front in condemning the russia actions and calling for a ceasefire today we are all georgians mccain said tuesday  watch mccain declare we are all georgians   when the crisis broke out last week the obama camp called for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict echoing the statements from the white house and the european union as russia planes bombed georgian cities and russian troops advanced into georgia obama who is on vacation in hawaii condemned russias actions and called for a ceasefire  watch obama condemn russias actions   mccain said wednesday that the crisis was not the time for partisan attacks i know the people of georgia have enjoyed an unprecedented period of prosperity and freedom and i know that at this time theyre suffering mightily the arizona republican said so maybe later on in the campaign lets have a backandforth about who has comments or statements now lets devote all our energy to helping resolve a situation which is fraught with human tragedy but despite mccain comments the crisis in georgia has dominated the political debate between the two candidates campaigns in recent days on tuesday randy scheunemann mccains top foreign policy adviser attacked the presumptive democratic presidential nominees response to the situation in georgia saying his experience with the region amounted to a handful of paper statements on the other hand mccains experience with georgia runs deep scheunemann said noting that mccain and the georgian president were friends theres a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that doesnt compare between the two on russia policy scheunemann said you cant compare a 15year historical record to three or four statements over the course of 15 months but susan rice obamas senior foreign policy adviser said tuesday that mccains comments condemning russia may or may not have complicated the situation we cannot shoot from the hip rice told msnbc on tuesday we cannot act on the basis of ideology or preconceived notions when this crisis began barack obama the administration  and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them mccain spokesman tucker bounds said wednesday that his campaign was disappointed that rice had launched inflammatory and baseless political attacks during an international crisis when bipartisanship is needed most in response hari sevugan a spokesman for the obama said it was the absolute height of hypocrisy for the mccain campaign to play the victim after attacking obamas strong and appropriate position on georgia bill schneider a cnn senior political analyst said mccain could use the situation in georgia to highlight one his inherent advantages over obama his experience but mccains strong position in defiance of russia also has risks schneider said some voters may worry does he want to start a new cold war the risk for mccain is that he could overplay the issue and frighten warweary voters whose priorities right now lie closer to home schneider said cnns peter hamby contributed to this report,"russias participation in wto g8 at risk because of georgia

d2e357c372891291bbdb4f496792ea9d5807cd3a,los angeles california cnn  a magnitude54 earthquake shook the los angeles metropolitan area tuesday leaving residents rattled but causing no serious damage or injuries bricks and other debris clutter an alleyway in pomona near los angeles tuesday afternoon however the temblor served as a warning to southern californians who had not experienced an earthquake in some time the big one remains a possibility this is a sample a small sample said kate hutton a seismologist at the california institute of technology this is somewhere between small and moderate she said there is a 5 percent chance the quake could be a precursor to a larger earthquake after 24 hours she said that chance will drop to 1 percent every earthquake relieves some stress hutton said its usually only a drop in the ocean in other words the amount of stress released by this earthquake is minuscule compared to the amount thats built up and is building up for the big one when it happens some day in the future  watch hutton say tuesdays quake was a sign of bigger ones to come   and when will that be from a geologists point of view the answer has to be soon she said but geologists are used to thinking on millions of years and thousands of years time scale so i dont think that gives any useful information for people except be prepared at any time because it could happen at any time a 54 magnitude quake is considered by the usgs to be moderate which can cause slight damage to buildings and others structures so far this year 39 moderate earthquakes of between magnitude 50 and 59 have occurred in the united states and 790 globally the last moderate quake to strike california was a magnitude 54 in april in the northern part of the state a magnitude 44 struck the greater los angeles area in august 2007 there is a 99 percent chance of california experiencing a quake of magnitude 67 or larger within the next 30 years according to the uniform california earthquake rupture forecast sponsored by the us geological survey the california geological survey and the southern california earthquake center and published in science daily in april this earthquake reminds us to be prepared said california gov arnold schwarzenegger we were very fortunate that there were no serious injuries or property damage he said he believes the state is as prepared as anyone can be we have continuous discussions about that we are fanatics about emergencies and to be ready the largest earthquake in recent years in california was a magnitude 71 in 1999 hutton said but it was centered in the desert near twentynine palms in a sparsely populated area tuesdays quake struck about 1142 am according to the usgs its epicenter was about 2 miles southwest of chino hills and about 5 miles southeast of diamond bar the epicenter was about 76 miles deep making it a fairly shallow quake according to cnn meteorologist chad meyers in general earthquakes centered closer to the surface produce stronger shaking and can cause more damage than those further underground but most southern california earthquakes tend to be fairly shallow officials said more than 30 aftershocks were recorded hutton said the largest was a magnitude 36 los angeles police said a downtown hotel sustained some structural damage but no one was injured and the building was not evacuated there were some unconfirmed reports of minor injuries the white house was also monitoring the situation said spokeswoman dana perino despite the absence of serious damage or injuries some los angelesarea residents were left rattled the quake was felt as far south as san diego california and the usgs said it received reports of light shaking as far north as rosamond california about 55 miles northnortheast of los angeles reports from those who felt the quake poured into cnn did you feel the quake my house was like a fun house everything was moving said danny casler 28 of huntington beach he said he was sleeping when his house began shaking and some things fell in the living room he said he ran out of the house in his boxer shorts attorney kevin crisp said he was on the phone with his law partner in riverside 65 miles away who burst out big quake crisp said he felt it about five seconds later this was very impressive long and very uniform really had the building going he said doors were swinging on the hinges and bottles of wine were rolling back and forth on his shelf it just started with a really strong jolt said wendy criner i ran and got my daughters from different rooms and we squatted in the living room i did have stuff fall off the shelf some books in my daughters room and some things in the kitchen the quake knocked out a ground radar system at los angeles international airport but that has not interfered with operations according to the federal aviation administration technicians were working to restore the system which helps controllers monitor traffic on the ground also tiles fell from the ceiling in one terminal as water flowed from a burst pipe the calculation of the quakes magnitude fluctuated as seismologists reviewed the data initially classified as a magnitude 58 the quakes intensity was reduced to a 56 and then to a 54 because the earthquake magnitude scale is exponential a 58 magnitude quake is four to five times more intense than a 54 two nuclear plants are in the vicinity of the quakes epicenter near chino hills according to the nuclear regulatory commission the closest to the epicenter is in san onofre 50 miles south but an nrc spokesman said this is well below the threshold for any conceivable damage to the plants in the us particularly in california buildings are generally built well enough that it takes about a 55 for there to be some damage so we do have the potential for damage said don blakeman an analyst for the usgs it depends on the structures and the ground the building is built on he said he would expect objects to be knocked from shelves and some windows broken its kind of on the margin where youll get some structural damage from these we may find that some of the older homes and buildings that werent retrofitted suffer more damage than the newer structures i would expect some cracked buildings he said there is the potential for injuries but hopefully we wont have too much of that blakemans comments came before the quakes magnitude was dropped to a 54 however he said afterward that the change does not affect his expectations although obviously there is less potential for damage

musharraf and the newly elected pakistani parliament if he made a decision to go or fight against it  we didnt advise him either way the official said we really did keep our fingers out of this one

center for strategic and international studies who is a former un and us official it could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country musharraf told the nation in a televised address monday that he would step down  nearly nine years after he seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty he said until now musharraf 65 had stubbornly resisted pressure to resign but his onceconsiderable power eroded significantly since februarys election that pushed his party out of power that pressure increased in the past few weeks as the new ruling party began making plans to impeach him only time will tell whether the power shift will benefit pakistan but it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the

62066d76f4ef9e06a1129551c41371bb5d2f7465,washington cnn  a slim majority of americans think churches should stay out of politics according to a new survey john mccain the rev rick warren and barack obama together for a cnn broadcast forum on faith the survey suggests that for the first time in more than a decade there has been a shift away from the view that religious groups should influence social and political issues fiftytwo percent of poll respondents said churches should stay quiet while 46 percent said churches should express political views the biggest shift has come among republicans one of the authors of the poll said overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points said greg smith a research fellow at the pew forum on religion  public life there is a slight uptick from 40 percent to 46 percent among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion but it is up 10 points among republicans he added four years ago seven out of 10 conservatives approved of religious institutions expressing political views but five out of 10 conservatives in thursdays poll said it was appropriate it seems that the more important social issues are to conservatives the more likely they were to say that religion and politics should not mix among people who said gay marriage was a very important issue the number saying houses of worship should keep out of politics doubled from 25 percent to 50 percent among those who said it was not important the number was essentially unchanged respondents were also more likely to say houses of worship should not meddle in politics if they considered the major political parties to be hostile to religion the new figures bring republican views into line with those of democrats and independents a 14point gap between republican and democratic views on the subject in august 2004 fell to one point in the new survey but smith cautioned against reading the survey to mean basic conservative philosophy was changing it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift he said it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all smith added republican candidate sen john mccain has a huge lead even among younger evangelicals but social conservatives are lukewarm about mccain as compared to president bush nearly seven out of 10 white evangelical protestants and conservatives said they supported mccain

backed him but not strongly the number of people who think religious groups have too much influence over political parties grew  for both republicans and democrats  as did the percentage of people who

have prolife policies he said when obama was asked about when life begins the prochoice candidate said that decision is above my pay grade the response garnered criticism from liberal and conservative thinkers who said obama tried to dodge the issue obama said although hes prochoice and supports a womans right to abortion his goal is to reduce the number of abortions in america on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception  and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that he said what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of

democrats to come back for a vote reacting to pelosis remarks house minority leader john boehner rohio said the speaker should call the house of representatives back from its summer recess immediately if she is sincere about a vote on offshore drilling our message to speaker pelosi is very simple we are ready to vote on more energy production and lower gas prices right now and we should not wait one more day to begin giving the american people the relief they expect and deserve boehner said if you meant what you said last night we welcome you and your democratic colleagues to join us in our historic call to action on american energy on monday night pelosi said the vote would need to be part of a larger discussion that would include investing in renewable energy resources and releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve those options would help bring both immediate and longlasting solutions to the energy crisis she said in her interview with king pelosi talked about what the government and country needs to do to avert the energy crisis and quickly bring down gas prices the following is an edited version of the interview  larry king ok madam speaker author of know your power why dont you bring congress back speaker nancy pelosi well its interesting to hear sen john mccain talk about bringing congress back he wasnt even in congress this last session when we really had two very important bills on energy  one to give tax credit for wind solar and other renewable resources and another about hybrid cars and the rest so he wasnt in to vote when were in session and now hes saying call it back in and then one of the others said to the president call congress back in and the president said no the president said no but the point is this the american people are suffering we have to do what is best for them how do we bring down the prices at the pump we have said to the president the fastest way to do this if in 10 days the price can come down if you will free our oil over 700 million barrels of oil the president is sitting on of the strategic petroleum reserve no 1 free our oil no 2 they want to drill if they want to drill we have 68 million acres in the lower 48 that they can drill in that are permitted and all the rest three stop the speculation four renew  invest in renewable energy resources which will bring a faster return than drilling offshore which will take 10 years and produce 2 cents reduction in 10 years off the price at the pump and then use natural gas natural gas is so plentiful its better for the environment and it is cheaper so there are things that congress can do and we have voted on this over and over again but the republicans and the president have resisted instead they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them king would you vote yes on a package that includes drilling pelosi i would not it depends how the drilling is put forth but i dont  that is not excluded let me say it that way it depends how that is proposed if the safeguards are there now mind you 68 million acres  10 million more acres in alaska where they can drill but if theres  if we can get some great things in terms of renewable energy resources a renewable electricity standard wind solar biofuels and the rest in that context because if you make a decision only to go with the offshore drilling you are increasing our dependence on fossil fuels and you will never free yourself of that addiction unless you invest in the renewable energy resources that are good for the environment cheaper for the consumer and will reverse global warming and the consumer is our first responsibility the american taxpayer owns this oil offshore by the way let me make this one final point this oil is owned by the american taxpayers the oil companies drill we give them money to drill there but we get very little in return so i think as we have this debate which is a very healthy one to have and i welcome it we have to review and realign the relationship between our oil big oils profits and what it means to the consumer and the taxpayer king do you expect  do you suspect the oil companies of having a lot of clout here influence over the republicans pelosi of course yes they rule and thats what well find out king they rule pelosi when we have this vote when we really define it and where the choice is clear to the american people  i mean do you know what  exxon mobil their last quarter their profits were historic last year they were historic they outdid themselves this year already in this second quarter and they insist that we pay them to drill they need an incentive to drill in order to make over 11 billion in one quarter and it just doesnt make sense we should be using that money to invest in renewable resources tax credit for wind and solar etc and invest in the technologies that will develop the battery and the rest instead of giving big oil more profits king do you expect to get a big enough majority in the senate and house for the democrats to overcome anything and get through your proposals pelosi well i hope we can do some of it before we even leave this session i think we can  hopefully we can do something before december i will not subscribe to a hoax on the american people that if you drill offshore youre going to bring down the price at the pump even the president says thats not true ten years two cents  were saying 10 days bring down the price if the president would free our oil from the strategic petroleum reserve  from our stockpile  owned by the taxpayers purchased by the taxpayers in the next election i know that we will strengthen our majorities increase their numbers and we will have a democratic president in the white house and we will be able to address more fully really what i think is the challenge to our generation  energy security and global warming,"new house minority leader calls for immediate vote on offshore drilling 
house speaker says shed be open for a vote on drilling as part of a larger package 
pelosi releasing oil from strategic reserves would quickly reduce gas prices 
we should be using that money to invest in renewable resources pelosi says ",House speaker nancy pelosi reversed her opposition to a vote on offshore drilling on larry king live on monday night saying she would consider a vote if it were part of a larger energy package. pelosi said vote would need to be part of larger discussion that would include investing in renewable energy resources and releasing oil.

de3ba4e29501a10effcbb5a61e7b9c0ab3721669,los angeles california cnn  theres no question tropic thunder takes chances ben stiller left and robert downey jr are among the stars of tropic thunder a hollywood satire tom cruise almost unrecognizable as a foulmouthed foulmannered movie executive check mockery of action heroes method actors and grossout comedians check challenging stereotypes at every opportunity absolutely but casting robert downey jr as a black man well that might be a bit much or maybe not in tropic thunder a comedy about selfabsorbed hollywood types making a platoonstyle war movie downey plays australian actor kirk lazarus a multiple oscarwinning performer who gets so involved in his roles that he forgets to come out of them hes a man constantly looking for ways to transform himself for his art so cast as a black man in the war movie lazarus decides to dye his skin surgically downey  no slouch as an actor himself  has often been seen as one who immerses himself fully in his roles that kind of dedication prevented the character from coming off as offensive said ben stiller who directed cowrote and stars in tropic thunder i give all the credit to robert stiller told cnn i felt he really was so committed to that character the guy that was playing that guy that as an audience you bought his sincerity very few people i think could pull that off brandon jackson who plays hiphop star turned actor alpa chino say it fast agreed robert was black the whole time my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle he told cnn im serious thats how black he was  watch jackson talk about working with downey   the movie which also stars stiller as struggling action star tugg speedman and jack black as grossout king jeff portnoy features some testy altercations between downeys lazarus and jacksons chino lazarus gets so involved in his role that even when its clear filming has wrapped for the day he sticks with it  which irritates chino to no end to me the most important thing was alpa chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what hes doing is crazy the whole time downey said otherwise its just demeaning to brandons character and if its demeaning to an actual black man in the movie  i would have run for the hills jackson said he would have challenged the movie if the material was offensive but he said tropic thunder is a long way from the days when white performers would don blackface as a way of exploiting black stereotypes since then he said the playing field has leveled the wayans brothers played white chicks in the film of the same name and eddie murphy has played several ethnicities in his films including jewish and chinese characters if were all gonna play ball lets all play ball jackson said i believe in fairness if we can punch you punch back and funny is funny ireportcom will you see tropic thunder stiller of course is no stranger to testing comedy limits the actor writer and director known for films such as meet the parents and zoolander has performed or created roles that strike a delicate balance between sympathetic and distasteful  and sometimes fall too hard on one side of the line he cowrote tropic thunder based on an idea he had in 1987 when many of his friends were making war movies he recalls in the films production notes while stiller was making empire of the sun his colleagues were in boot camps training for their military roles  and would emerge talking about the boot camp as if theyd become part of a real military unit this sort of selfimportant selfinvolved thing seemed funny to me he said in the notes i just couldnt figure a way to make that into a movie not immediately anyway but after several years stiller and his colleagues worked out a story that not only mocked actors but filmmaking in general in thunder after the studio threatens to shut down the bigbudget production the frustrated director played by steve coogan refuses to stop and takes his cast deep into a southeast asia jungle to shoot guerrilla style there they encounter danger in the form of drug lords tropic thunder which already has received praise from newsweeks david ansen and the hollywood reporters kirk honeycutt has also earned its share of knocks the most serious have come from advocacy groups for the disabled which are planning to picket mondays los angeles premiere in the film speedman has made a bid for an oscar by playing simple jack a developmentally disabled character other characters in tropic thunder dismiss speedmans attempt to play what they refer to as a retard representatives of the special olympics the arc of the united states the national down syndrome congress the american association of people with disabilities and other groups met with studio executives last week to discuss the film but dreamworks did not make any changes we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population said peter wheeler a spokesman for the special olympics according to reuters in a statement sunday chip sullivan a dreamworks spokesman said the movie was an rrated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and overthetop characters in ridiculous situations in the statement sullivan added that the film was not meant to disparage or harm people with disabilities and that dreamworks expected to work closely with disability groups in the future in junket interviews for the film stiller said that screening audiences definitely found tropic thunder funny you go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think youre doing of what you think is the right idea he said if people are accepting it the way that you intended and you feel that from a general audience  then stand behind it downey trusts that after years of making themselves known as actors who can skillfully walk that fine line between funny and offensive audiences will accept the films satire  his role in particular i just hope at this point with whatever little weve done to brand ourselves as entertainers that you give us a little slack he said cnn entertainment correspondent kareen wynter contributed to this report,"tropic thunder pushes boundaries at every opportunity

around a 27kilometer 17mile tunnel deep beneath the border of france and switzerland in an attempt to unlock the secrets of the universe scientists applaud during the switch on operation of the large hadron collider the large hadron collider  a 9 billion particle accelerator designed to simulate conditions of the big bang that created the physical universe  was switched on at 0732 gmt to cheers and applause from experts gathered to witness the event while observers were left nonplussed by the anticlimactic flashing dots on a tv screen that signalled the machines successful test run among teams of scientists involved around the world there were jubilant celebrations and popping champagne corks in the coming months the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions skeptics who claim that the experiment could lead to the creation of a black hole capable of swallowing the planet failed in a legal bid to halt the project at cern the european organization for nuclear research others have branded it a colossal waste of cash draining resources from its multinational collaborators that could have been spent on scientific research with more tangible benefits to mankind sound off what do you think of the experiment french president nicolas sarkozy hailed the project as a major achievement for europe the repercussions of this scientific investment without precedent in the history of humanity will be essential not only for the intimate knowledge of our universe but also for the direct applications in fields as varied as intensive calculation or even medicine he said  watch as big bang experiment gets underway   the collider will operate at higher energies and intensities in the next year potentially generating enough data to make a discovery by 2009 experts say they say the experiment has the potential to confirm theories that physicists have been working on for decades including the possible existence of extra dimensions they also hope to find a theoretical particle called the higgs boson  sometimes referred to as the god particle which has never been detected but would help explain why matter has mass the collider will recreate the conditions of less than a millionth of a second after the big bang when there was a hot soup of tiny particles called quarks and gluons to look at how the universe evolved said john harris us coordinator for alice a huge detector specialized to analyze that question since this is exploratory science the collider may uncover surprises that contradict prevailing theories but which are just as interesting said joseph lykken theoretical physicist at the fermi national accelerator laboratory when columbus sails west he thought he was going to find something he didnt find what he thought he was going to find but he did find something interesting said lykken who works on the compact muon solenoid one of six experiments inside the collider complex why should the layperson care about this particular exploration years ago when electrons were first identified no one knew what they were good for but they have since transformed our entire economy said howard gordon deputy research program manager for the colliders atlas experiment the transformative effect of this research will be to understand the world we live in much better said gordon at brookhaven national laboratory its important for just who we are what we are fears have emerged that the collider could produce black holes that could suck up anything around them  including the whole earth such fears prompted legal actions in the us and europe to halt the operation of the large hadron collider alleging safety concerns regarding black holes and other phenomena that could theoretically emerge although physicists acknowledge that the collider could in theory create small black holes they say they do not pose any risk a study released friday by cern scientists explains that any black hole created would be tiny and would not have enough energy to stick around very long before dissolving five collider collaborators who did not pen the report independently told cnn there would be no danger from potential black holes john huth who works on the colliders atlas experiment called such fears baloney in a recent interview and noted that in normal physics even if the black hole were stable it could just pass through the earth without being detected or without interacting at all the gravitational force is so weak that youd have to wait many many many many many lifetimes of the universe before one of these things could get big enough to even get close to being a problem said huth professor of physics at harvard university cnns

times than i can count and it has turned me from a happygolucky columnist into a bitter paranoid germaphobe she has become the bane of my existence we live in a world where our soldiers lack sufficient body armor where rupert murdoch is blurring the line intended to keep the business and political interests of media owners from influencing the presentation of news where the white house still refuses to respond to questions they promised to answer as soon as the scooter libby case was closed where studies indicate that worrying youre going to get sick will actually get you sick  and yet i am devoting an entire column to the tinkler any shrink worth his or her salt will tell you that it is a mistake to think of your colleagues as family but what is a family if not a group of people who care about you and irritate you and show up for cake on your birthday and look at pictures of your kid even when they dont feel like it and think it wouldnt kill you to put on a little makeup and a pair of heels once in a while ive been earning a paycheck for 30 years whether rinsing conditioner off a lhasa apso during my stint as shampoo girl at mr whiskers pet boutique or breathing on the chicken breast i was about to serve a rude diner during my waitressing days ive always found that the people i work with matter to me their moods their opinions their style influence

primitive as if shes marking her territory this is clearly a hostile gesture suzan declares with authority were finally getting somewhere so really i say we just need to be on the lookout for an aggressively meanspirited molelike cavewoman who is not confined to a wheelchair  is that right val is the first to realize that were losing our minds im out of here she says and exits the ladies room

jean valjean of stealing silver candlesticks think about it she says what better way to cover your tracks than writing an outraged piece on the subject i kind of like that gina believes i am an evil genius and i dont have the heart to tell her that i once refused to sit my daughter on the lap of a department store santa claus because i had no idea who else had been sitting there another day

trafficking and prostitution ring with links throughout latin america and europe marita veron who is missing hugs her daughter micaela police believe marita was forced into sexual slavery trimarco 54 has spent the past 6 years searching for her daughter often putting herself at risk while chasing down leads on maritas whereabouts shes entered dark and dangerous brothels and confronted pimps and politicians who she says are complicit in her daughters disappearance she has won accolades throughout latin america europe and the united states for her work but marita is nowhere to be found marita is a wonderful and caring girl my life will be completely absorbed with this fight until she is back and safe trimarco said on april 3 2002 veron left her house in the northern argentine province of tucuman early for a doctors appointment she was wearing a turquoise shirt blue jeans and old white sneakers as she left the house she told her mother dont worry ill be back soon those were the last words the two exchanged the investigation that has followed has led police and trimarco to believe that she was kidnapped and forced into prostitution either in rural argentina or spain so far a series of random clues has failed to provide any concrete information on maritas whereabouts now art is imitating life on argentinas airwaves trimarcos story has become the basis of one of argentinas most popular nighttime soap operas vidas robadas or stolen lives  watch art imitate activism   the program premiered in march on telefe one of argentinas largest television networks to a lukewarm response but as the storyline and characters evolved and word started to spread the audience grew and it became watercooler television stolen lives attracts more than 2 million viewers nightly a considerable feat considering argentinas population is only 40 million the shows plot centers on widowed anthropologist bautista amaya played by facundo arana and rosario soler soledad silveyra  the mother of a young kidnapped girl based on trimarco  who team up to unravel an underground prostitution ring with every performance i try to display the inner feelings of this woman who is suffering to transmit her grief silveyra said as an actress i feel an enormous responsibility the usual telenovela themes of love passion and revenge are ever present in stolen lives but the show strives to expose an issue that has remained in the dark in argentina until recently human rights groups in argentina estimate that 800 women have gone missing at the hands of human traffickers since 2007 worldwide about 800000 people are trafficked across borders annually according to the us state department i am delighted that the show has been able to bring this topic to light because no one ever talked about human trafficking in argentina before trimarco said stolen lives is the latest in a series of recent argentine telenovelas that dissect important social issues while also aiming to entertain one of the most important was the 2006 hit montecristo which examined crimes against humanity committed by argentinas military during the 1970s and 1980s local versions of montecristo are produced in nine countries around the globe including turkey portugal mexico and russia with these types of telenovelas we are able to bring something entirely new to the public debate and because we take a take a fictional and not a journalistic approach we are able to attract and keep more viewers telefe programming director claudio villarruel said montecristo helped reunite children of argentinas dirty war who disappeared with lost family members the dirty war happened from 197683 when the government carried out a secret campaign to purge the country of those it considered to be dissidents stolen lives

condoleezza rice at a ceremony in washington later this year trimarco will travel to spain to speak about human trafficking with lawmakers from the european union its just like condoleezza rice told me my screams are being heard all over the world she said trimarco travels around argentina constantly educating people about human trafficking and following up on clues about marita she is also raising maritas daughter micaela 9 with all the publicity surrounding the case and the success of stolen lives trimarco has herself become a target her accusations of political and police involvement have led to death threats she says still she remains committed to the cause and says that collaborating with the producers of stolen lives to tell her story has helped give her the strength to

to a report released friday by the defense department rear adm john stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the navy staff in march when the report was submitted to pentagon officials rear adm john stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the navy staff stufflebeem told investigators he couldnt remember the name of the woman he had an affair with he also lied when he told investigators he did not engage in sexual relations with the woman identified as jane doe the defense departments inspector generals report said jane doe who was then unmarried and working for a federal agency told the investigators the allegations were true the report said her supervisor and stufflebeems superiors supported her testimony stufflebeem was convicted april 18 of making false official statements to investigators after the hearing called an admirals mast he requested retirement jane doe told investigators that she and stufflebeem began their affair on an overseas trip in 1989 that the married admiral told her he was a widower who was raising his children as a single parent and that they had sexual relations several times including once in a white house room reserved for military aides with overnight duties she also told investigators that stufflebeem came to her home on the day in august 1990 when she learned he was married and that she called him scum shut the door in his face and never spoke to him again read the report pdf we found ms doe to be an extremely credible candid and articulate witness who willingly participated in our interview with the knowledge and support of her husband the report said by contrast the report said stufflebeems testimony was inconsistent with the weight of the evidence and it did not appear stufflebeems misstatements in these areas of testimony were inadvertent at issue was stufflebeems removal from his post as a presidential aide in 1990 stufflebeem testified that he initiated the request to leave his white house post because of close family personal problems but his superiors testified that he was removed from the post because of his relationship with the woman  and that he admitted the affair jane does supervisor told investigators that when she learned of the affair from doe she confirmed stufflebeems marital status and told doe what shed learned ms does reaction according to the supervisor was one of complete surprise and shock the report said the supervisor also said that she telephoned stufflebeems immediate supervisor to tell him of the affair and that when she called a few weeks later to follow up the supervisor told her that everybody in town knew boomer was fing some bimbo at the federal agency stufflebeem however denied to investigators that he had a sexual relationship with jane doe although he admitted to one kiss and said he had an inappropriate relationship with her because he told her about his marital problems i did not have sex with this woman he said during one of two interviews with investigators although he told investigators he could not remember the womans name he testified that he had to live with shame for a long time after the inappropriate relationship ended that he was racked with guilt and had a terrible time getting myself right with my family so i have had a great 18year career since i left the white house he said according to the report if this is the end of it then i still leave a rewarded individual thankful for the blessings that i have had investigators found stufflebeems remarks inconsistent in our view comments regarding guilt shame and the end of a distinguished naval career are incongruous with a physical relationship limited to one kiss they wrote in the report this year according to the report the inspector generals office provided stufflebeem with its preliminary findings that hed provided false and misleading testimony regarding the nature of his relationship with jane doe his inability to recall her name and his representation to her of himself as a widower stufflebeem responded with a vehement denial i find it extremely regrettable in a case that has such far reaching implications for my career that you have chosen to question my integrity he wrote in a february 15 letter the unfortunate truth in this case is that as a result of lack of evidence to substantiate the allegation of a sexual relationship and in lieu of investigating the underlying allegations you have chosen to accuse me of being untruthful as i defended myself against these allegations stufflebeem further castigated the investigators because at that time they had chosen not to interview jane doe in deference to ms does privacy according to the report doe readily agreed to testify when they contacted her after stufflebeems rebuttal ms doe confirmed that she and stufflebeem had an extensive physical relationship which began on an overseas trip and lasted intermittently for approximately eight months the investigators wrote the relationship included sexual intercourse on approximately one dozen occasions to include intercourse during overseas travel in the white house and in her home doe also said stufflebeem told her that his wife had died of breast cancer that a woman who answered the phone when she called his home was the childrens nanny and that he continued to wear his wedding ring for his daughters who missed their late mother according to the report the investigation began when investigators received an anonymous letter containing significant details about the affair investigators had received another such letter in 1999 but it contained no detail and was not investigated stufflebeem became well known in the initial months of the war in afghanistan when he often conducted oncamera television briefings as a pentagon spokesman he was then deputy director for global operations on the joint staff he was commander of the 6th fleet from may 2005 to september

may never arrive guatemala has announced it will conduct a casebycase review of every pending foreign adoption case they and thousands of prospective parents eager to adopt children from abroad have found themselves in an emotional legal limbo since two of the most popular countries for international adoptions  guatemala and vietnam  recently halted their programs now wouldbe mothers and fathers around the united states wonder what will become of their quest to adopt a child  a pursuit that can fray nerves cost up to 30000 and span several years guatemala announced this month that it would conduct a casebycase review of every pending foreign adoption case that put on hold the adoption plans of about 2000 american families the crackdown comes amid reports that some in guatemala coerce mothers to relinquish their children for adoption  or steal the children outright and present them as orphans similar accusations have arisen in vietnam after the united states accused adoption agencies there of corruption and babyselling vietnam said in april that it would no longer allow adoptions to the united states my husband and i were absolutely devastated teresinski said adoptive parents have put a lot of emotional energy and a lot of financial resources in the process vietnams decision affects several hundred families families in the united states adopted 4728 children from guatemala and 828 from vietnam last year the halt in adoptions from those two nations unfolds against the backdrop of a dramatic rise in international adoptions in the united states the number of foreignborn children adopted by us families more than tripled from 1990 to 2004 when it reached a high of 22884 though the figure has declined slightly each year since in 2007 the us granted visas to 19613 children so they could join an adoptive family in the united states according to us state department figures about 70 percent of those children came from four countries china guatemala russia and ethiopia a few other countries have also halted foreign adoptions at various times including kazakhstan and togo yet the suspensions in vietnam and guatemala have had the biggest impact  theyre two of the 10 countries that send the most children to adoptive homes in the unites states fear of fraud stirs heartache  for darcy the review seems more detrimental than helpful her adopted daughter carolina remains in a guatemalan foster home with three dozen other babies darcy worries that keeping carolina now 15 months old in a foster home will harm her early development shes not getting oneonone care by a consistent caretaker darcy said adding later nobody is looking at this as a violation of the kids human rights except for these american parents guatemala which until now has had little to no oversight of its foreign adoptions has the highest per capita rate of adoption in the world nearly one in 100 babies born in guatemala wind up living with adoptive parents in the united states according to the us consulate in guatemala while adoptive parents in the united states undergo rigorous screening adoptions in guatemala had been processed by notaries responsible for determining whether the babies were relinquished voluntarily they also arrange foster care and handle paperwork  notaries in latin america tend to have more legal training than notaries in the united states both guatemalan and us officials fear the system leads to practices such as paying birth mothers for children or in some instances coercion officials in both countries say gaps in regulations and the high sums of money at play  adoptions can cost up to 30000  may have created unintended incentives in a country where the state department estimates that 80 percent of the population lives in poverty the guatemalan government has said its review could take a month or longer as for the american families they can only wait i think its overkill said darcy who was matched with carolina last march and was approved to adopt the girl last winter  typically one of the last steps before the actual adoption is complete no adoptive parent wants to adopt an abducted child  a child that wasnt voluntarily relinquished  but to keep them as hostages is unacceptable darcy said guatemala plans reforms  us officials say they sympathize with the parents but that reviews like the one in guatemala are in the best interest of the children we feel for them its a tough situation said a state department official who is not authorized to speak on the record but theyll have the comfort of knowing american parents in the future who adopt from guatemala will get children from a system that has all the safeguards in place so that children are not exploited the official said in the past guatemala required birth mothers to sign a document in court saying they were relinquishing their child they were not required to reveal their reasons now the government may require the presence of the birth mother and child the goal is to verify identification and make sure the mother is giving up her child voluntarily cleaning up guatemalas adoption system is a step toward complying with the standards of the hague convention on intercountry adoption an international agreement that governs adoptions from one country to another about 70 nations have signed the convention which seeks to ensure legitimate foreign adoptions the united states joined the international convention last year and rules governing adoptions from one signatory nation to another took effect april 1 the united states has stopped issuing visas to guatemalan children after that date blocking their travel to america  at least until concerns are addressed were not pointing fingers at american parents the state department official said however the review and changes in guatemala will ensure that it does not become a fertile ground for wrongful practices on any person particularly children who have not been orphaned to offset corruption the us embassy has added its own requirement that birth mothers appear with the baby to request a visa for the baby in august officials also began requiring two dna tests to confirm the identities of mother and child still the guatemalan solicitor generals office has identified at least 80 cases of adoption irregularities including baby stealing and false dna tests and the guatemalan chief prosecutors office recently launched a criminal investigation into the two laboratories contracted to take dna samples from birth mothers and children serious irregularities in vietnam  similar concerns of corruption recently emerged in vietnam where investigators had found serious adoption irregularities according to a report by the us embassy in hanoi documents had been forged or altered the embassy said and some parents were paid tricked or forced into giving up their children for adoption in some cases the embassy said children were offered for adoption without the knowledge or permission of their parents the vietnamese government has denied the accusations even so it said in april that it would terminate its adoption agreement with the united states saying it wont accept applications after july 1 the program is scheduled to end september 1 parents in the united states who were matched with an adoptive child in vietnam before july 1 will be allowed to adopt that child prospective parents who had invested time and money but had not been matched with an adoptive child appear to be out of luck private adoption agencies insist that nearly all adoptions from vietnam are problemfree and they want the adoptions to continue its hard to let go because we know we can advocate for these children and make a real difference said linda brownlee executive director of the nonprofit adoption center of washington which places children for adoption from russia china cambodia and vietnam she hopes the united states and vietnam reach an agreement so that adoptions can continue without it i think children are going to be harmed they are going to die needlessly and there is going to be trafficking brownlee said,"guatemala and vietnam say corruption babystealing

kruimel told cnn they will appear before a judge friday for a preliminary arrest hearing in which the judge determines whether the arrest was credible she said the judge can then authorize their being detained for eight more days meaning police have that much time to produce evidence the suspects then go before a judge again she said van der sloot was arrested in arnhem the netherlands by dutch police kruimel said aruban authorities have asked for him to be extradited to aruba within eight days because they were not familiar with the case dutch police were not questioning van der sloot she said he will be questioned when he is brought back to aruba she said however he will appear before a judge thursday in arnhem when cnn called the kalpoe household the person who answered the phone hung up earlier van der sloots mother anita van der sloot told cnn her son had not been arrested but had only reported to a police station in the netherlands for questioning wednesday after receiving

exhaustive search and investigation and a media sensation in the united states aruba the netherlands and beyond but holloway has never been found aruban authorities have been criticized for their handling of the case at least 10 men including van der sloot and the kalpoes have been arrested and identified as suspects either in holloways disappearance or in an alleged coverup all were questioned and released legal experts however have said differences in the us and aruban systems should be taken into account arubas criminal justice system is based on dutch law and a descendant of the napoleonic code in aruba authorities reasonable suspicion that someone knows about or is involved in a crime is enough to make an arrest while magistrates investigate and judges determine a suspects guilt or innocence there are no jury trials aruban authorities meanwhile have suggested that holloway may have overdosed on drugs or died of alcohol poisoning beth holloway and natalee holloways father dave holloway filed a lawsuit last year against van der sloot and his father aruban judge paulus van der sloot in the supreme court of the state of new york the van der sloots were

3f33d4cb25cd121619ba99eeb02709b72716d622,aol autos  there is an old adage which goes something like this the cheap man always pays more in the long run consumer reports analyzed the cost of ownership across the 300 models in their database consumer reports magazine recently reached a similar conclusion when it announced the results of a study that compared the cost of ownership of more than 300 cars consumer reports noted that a car with a cheaper sticker price can often cost consumers more in the long run when compared to a higherpriced alternative the report which appeared in consumer reports annual april auto issue was based on a comparison of the 300 models in the consumer reports database in short the report concluded that a cars sticker price is one of many factors that should be taken into account when trying to decide between two cars in the same class for example at about 17500 a mitsubishi lancer is priced 5000 less than a mini cooper but when factoring in the total costs of ownership for each vehicle the lancer could cost drivers about 3000 more to own over the first five years according to the study and the purchase price of a toyota highlander is about 3000 more than a v6 ford explorer  but the explorers total cost of ownership is an extra 6500 over those five years the study took into account such factors as depreciation fuel costs interest paid on the car loan insurance maintenance repair costs and sales tax online subscribers to  can compare the costs for one three five and eight years of ownership we think this information is valuable for consumers who have shopped around and settled on a couple of different cars they like and then have to decide on one or the other noted cliff weathers consumer reports deputy editor autos were giving this information to the consumer to use as a tool to help them make that decision a tiebreaker if you will if theyre trying to decide between a pontiac solstice and mazda miata for example they can go to our web site and find out which one will cost less to own over that fiveyear period and in this particular case the answer would be the miata  which was one of the least expensive cars to own of all the cars evaluated in our survey depreciation was factored into the estimates based on the assumption that the vehicle will eventually be traded in when buyers make their next car purchase depreciation is the factor that accounts for the highest cost of ownership weathers explained depreciation accounts for 48 percent of the cost of ownership over the first five years different models depreciate faster and more significantly than others in order to calculate depreciation for this ownercost comparison consumer reports started with the price that a typicallyequipped model generally sells for if a particular model often sells at a largelydiscounted price that was also factored in consumer reports then deducted the wholesale tradein value of the car at the end of the period based on data from their used car price service weathers explained in those cases when consumer reports didnt have depreciation data for a new model it used estimates based on comparable vehicles the fuel factor  the secondbiggest factor in costofownership after depreciation is fuel costs which account for 21 percent of the total ownership costs fuel economy can really make a big difference weathers said if you have a car that gets 25 miles per gallon and another car that gets 19 miles per gallon thats a potential difference of thousands of dollars over five years if youre driving 12000 miles a year consumer reports calculated fuel costs by assuming that the vehicles would be driven 12000 miles a year  the average annual mileage reported by those who responded to consumer reports annual reader survey consumer reports then applied the national average price of regular gas as of december 2007 or if applicable the price of premium or diesel fuel fuel costs were an especially big factor with suvs the comparison revealed drivers who buy a dodge nitro could pay more than 10000 to fill up the tank over a fiveyear period for example but the fuel costs for a similarsized more fuelefficient toyota rav4 v6 would be 2000 less during that period consumer reports comparison also concluded that interest paid on car loans accounts for about 12 percent of fiveyear ownership costs that figure is based on a fiveyear loan with a 15 percent down payment using the average interest rate of 686 percent reported by bankratecom in december 2007 auto insurance accounts for about 11 percent of total ownership costs over five years according to the consumer reports comparison car insurance costs can vary depending on several factors such as the drivers age location and driving record auto insurance costs in some cases dramatically boosted the ownership costs of models that otherwise boasted reasonable ownership costs as an example weathers compared the difference in auto insurance rates for mitsubishi lancer evolution and a similarlypriced acura tl insurance for the lancer can cost you 2500 a year or more based our 2007 figures notes weathers meanwhile the annual car insurance rates for the acura tl can cost as little as 900 maintenance  repairs  surprisingly maintenance and car repairs account for only four percent of the cost of ownership weathers said the maintenance and repair cost figures used in consumer reports cost of ownership comparison were based on information gleaned from more than a million respondents in its annual car reliability survey one notable conclusion reached in the consumer reports study is that lexus  models have relatively high maintenance and repair costs  primarily due to maintenance alone even though lexus owners reported excellent reliability the lexus es350 racks up an average of 2300 in maintenance and repair in the first five years meanwhile owners of a comparable lincoln mkz can expect to pay only half that much another interesting tidbit discovered in the comparison is that the range rover is the most expensive vehicle on average for five and eight years when it comes to maintenance and repairs costing about 2000 in the fifth year alone meanwhile the comparable toyota land cruiser costs only 600 in that year to maintain and repair some might be surprised to hear that the sales tax on the purchase price of the vehicle accounts for as much of the cost of ownership as maintenance and repairs for its study consumer reports used the national average of 483 percent in 2007 with hybrid cars being a hot topic in the auto industry consumer reports was also interested in the cost of owning one of those fuelsipping vehicles the report concluded that toyota prius hybrid actually costs less to own than similar conventional models specifically the sale price of a prius is about 7500 higher than a similarlysized chevrolet cobalt but the total cost of ownership over five years is almost 2000 less  due primarily to its much lower fuel costs although the amount of depreciation was a factor as well weathers pointed to another interesting finding there are some vehicles namely bmw that are very inexpensive to own over first five years because all of the maintenance is paid for during that period under the warranty he says but if we take it forward the cost of maintenance and repairs over the next three years after that is going to be more expensive for more information on this study visit  to compare vehicle prices and specs for yourself check out the aol autos compare cars tool

martin says the three presidential candidates will never be regular folks cnn  can we all just stop the silly nonsense over who is an elitist and whether an average american will occupy the white house listening to the punditry today you would think folks who revel in the comedy of larry the cable guy or katt williams really would have a shot at the white house its totally absurd so sen barack obama is all of a sudden an elitist because he went to columbia and harvard and sen hillary clinton is an elitist because she went to yale do you actually think sen john mccain isnt an elitist he went to an exclusive college  the naval academy and that is one of the hardest places to get into you cant even apply unless a member of congress recommends you karl rove who tries to portray himself as the common man but is just another rich republican has called both democratic candidates elitists well his former boss president george w bush went to yale so did bushs dad former president george hw bush and his granddaddy former sen prescott bush all three bushes also were members of the super elite organization skull and bones the younger bush later went to harvard he walked into the governors mansion and the presidency on the strength of his name and his dads money and connections sounds like an elitist to me but no were supposed to be fooled by the cowboy boots folksy charm and him removing brush at his crawford texas ranch dont forget the family compound in kennebunkport maine where all the regular folks hang out surely you recall when bush nominated harriet miers for the supreme court those same conservative voices decrying the elitist democrats were blasting her because she went to little old southern methodist university that unremarkable  their view  university in dallas texas by the way that will be the home of the george w bush library you can bet a pitcher of beer that had she graduated from harvard yale or princeton she wouldnt have been derisively referred to as too plain and not educated enough by the elitists in the republican party and lets stay with the supreme court for a moment where did its members go to school chief justice john g roberts jr

have deluded ourselves into thinking the person elected to the white house is really and truly like the rest of us all three candidates dont know what its like to face the daunting health care challenges millions of americans are confronted with daily each are members of the us senate and they have the best health care money can buy for life  we pay for it while your pension plan is shot to hell their plan will never be underfunded the members will see to that courtesy of taxpayer dollars forget how many times obama bowls gutter balls clinton tosses back shots of whiskey and mccain talks about how hes a regular guy each courtesy of their 169300 annual salary makes far more than the average american and when it comes to wealth clinton gets to enjoy the 100 million she and her husband raked in since he left the white house even their hefty book advances dwarf regular authors mccains wife cindy runs one of anheuser buschs largest beer distributors and is worth more than 100 million they will never be living paychecktopaycheck obama is the poorest of the three but he did earn more than a million bucks courtesy of his bestselling books the audacity of hope and dreams from my father after delivering his 2004 keynote speech at the democratic national convention how many average americans wouldnt mind having a million dollars in their savings account bottom line the narrative about our presidential candidates being just regular folks is a tired myth that gets repeated each and every day and their efforts to show that they are just like us are really pathetic you dont have to go duck hunting be seen buying milk at the grocery store for your family or having a beer at the local bar to show that youre one of us just do what rich and highly educated folks do when they are in politics advance policies that will at least allow me to keep a few more dollars in my pocket and be able to afford a home one more thing dont buy fully into the nonsense tossed out by some of the loudest voices on television radio and in print who decry these elitists and trumpet that they are for the blue collar middleclass worker in middle america many of them pull down multimilliondollar salaries and run into these same candidates on marthas vineyard and in the hamptons when they all vacation they too will pull every favor they have to get their children in the posh

middlesbrough have decided against taking up the option of resigning brazilian midfielder fabio rochemback the premier league club had an option to extend brazilian rochembacks deal by another two years but manager gareth southgate has decided to let him go we both feel that the time is right for fabio to have a fresh challenge southgate said he is a talented footballer and i think hes just had his best season for us while it was fitting that he should bow out against manchester city on sunday with probably his best performance in a middlesbrough shirt the 26yearold joined boro from barcelona in 2005 and played 91 games for the teesside club he signed off in style by scoring a thumping longrange freekick in sundays 81 victory over city rochemback who netted seven times for boro played a major role in helping the club reach the 2006 uefa cup final a year after appearing in the final during a loan spell with sporting lisbon  where he is expected to move back to this summer mendieta 34 was one of footballs costliest players when he joined lazio from valencia for 48 million euros in 2001 but he disappointed and joined barcelona and then boro on loan the former spain midfielder joined permanently on a free transfer in 2004 but has not played for the first team since december 26 2006 it was a difficult situation for a player of gaizkas caliber to find himself out of the first team reckoning added southgate i made it clear to him that he did not figure in my plans but he decided to stay and try to get back into the first team that didnt work out but his attitude to training was always excellent and he was a good influence on some of our young reserve team players south korean international lee joined boro on a free transfer from pohang steelers in january 2007 he scored only twice in 11 starts and 18 appearances as a substitute and has not appeared for the first team since early february southgate is still hopeful of persuading goalkeeper mark schwarzer to sign a new contract at the riverside the 35yearold australian joined boro from bradford city in a 3 million deal in february 1997 and has played nearly 450 games for the club his deal runs out this summer and he has so far refused to sign an extension prompting reports of interest from a host of european clubs we are talking to mark id like him to stay his experience is important but he has real drive and determination that is still increasing said southgate he is the one in our dressing room that can truly say he has played at the highest level  in world cups in europe in cup finals and so on we have to negotiate and see where we go but players have to want to stay here and we have to want to keep them mark has been here a long time so he has to decide if he needs a fresh challenge whether what we are trying to do is going to excite him whether he feels he is going to be appreciated here southgate also confirmed they have offered striker tom craddock and rightback tony mcmahon oneyear extensions to their current deals which run out this summer brazilian rivaldo has changed his mind about retiring and says he will play for greek club aek again next season the 36yearold had decided to quit after aek were denied the title because olympiakos were awarded three points for a game they lost after the opposing team fielded an ineligible player the truth is that at the end of the championship i felt great disappointment and a sense of injustice but the love and support i have received from fans and the team have contributed to my final decision  i have decided to stay at aek next season rivaldo said in a statement on the clubs web site olympiakos lost 10 on february 3 but greek sports authorities gave them the points because apollon played roman wallner who had turned out for two other clubs during the season apollons appeal to the court of arbitration for sport was rejected on april 21 olympiakos finished the season with 70 points two ahead of aek for their 11th title in 12 years rivaldo who has played at ac milan and barcelona and starred in brazils 2002 world cup victory spent three seasons at olympiakos from 2004 he moved to aek last

4ebd9195bc8c12272b6281a5a610a7b5fb49b8cd,douglas arizona cnn  its a tale of homeland security concerns blocking wildlife management and the hue and cry that ensues this photo taken by warner glenn in 1996 is believed to be the first of a live jaguar in the united states when most people think of jaguars they think of the jungles of central and south america not the remote desert ranges between the united states and mexico that region is known as mountain lion country and thats what rancher warner glenn thought he was tracking when he saddled up his mules on a summer day 12 years ago near douglas arizona glenn has hunted mountain lions for 60 years since he was eight years old but glenn was stunned when he saw what his hunting dogs had chased up to a high mountain perch the rancher took whats believed to be the first photo of a live jaguar in the united states but it wasnt his last in 2006 some 40 miles away glenn and his hunting party again cornered a jaguar  a different one jaguars an endangered species have a breeding population in northern mexico scientists believe there are no more than 120 left in the wild there its believed that since 1910 the cats are only visitors north of the border they have been virtually unstudied here until recently but glenn and other conservationists worry that the possible return of breeding jaguars to the united states could be stopped in its tracks the reason the border fence last month the department of homeland security waived 30 environmental laws to finish 470 miles of the fence by the end of the year homeland security secretary michael chertoff told congress that the agency continues to talk to some 600 landowners along the border to get their input but in order to comply with the congressional mandate he said there is no time to deal with unnecessary delays caused by administrative processes or potential litigation we are currently in a lawless situation at the border says chertoff i feel an urgency to get this tactical infrastructure in and although were going to be respectful of the environment were going to be expeditious two environmental groups defenders of wildlife and the sierra club have filed appeals with the us supreme court claiming the waivers are unconstitutional and set a dangerous precedent national security and environmental protection do not have to be at odds with each other says defenders of wildlife spokesman matt clark if we can drop this arbitrary deadline for constructing the fence and go through the proper procedures then there are inevitably ways to minimize environmental impact but as it is now its throwing all of those laws out the window mountain lion tracker jack childs also worries about the impact of the fence on local wildlife especially the jaguar childs captured the first video of a live jaguar in the late summer of 1996 a few months after warner glenn  watch childs and glenn talk about efforts to preserve the jaguar   i knew historically there had been a few jaguars sighted in arizona but in the last hundred years never in any numbers his encounter sparked a passion for the big cats along with wife anna and biologist emil mccain he created the borderlands jaguar detection project  see images of the controversy   childs and mccain hike into remote mountain areas where the jaguars roam and have placed more than 50 motion sensor cameras near the border theyve taken 69 photos of three different jaguars since 2001 including several of the same cat childs first saw in 1996 he has nicknamed that cat macho b a jaguars spots are like fingerprints  each cat has a unique set one of the spots on macho b resembles a pinocchio cartoon figure and thats how they identify him we spend a lot of time walking along the border during the daytime and we actually find his tracks going through the fence so we know for sure that he crosses back and forth says childs a fence like that is going to inhibit wildlife movements and migrations back and forth its not going to effectively stop human traffic theyve got wire cutters and torches  see where the jaguars have been spotted   childs says the fence also has an impact on wildlife because drug runners and human traffickers have been pushed up into the mountain areas to avoid the fence in the lowland valleys its impacting the animals number one whats going on down there its almost brought my wildlife study to a stop because they the traffickers are tearing down my cameras as fast as im putting them up because they think were taking pictures of them the us fish and wildlife service finds itself in a unique position its mission is wildlife and habitat protection but it must uphold another federal agencys mission to override environmental concerns bill radke manager of the san bernardino wildlife refuge says the border patrol is trying to work with his agency the hope is that by working with border patrol that we can meet the national security mandate and at the same time protect the wildlife says radke border patrol is putting up camera towers but are putting them up on areas that are off the refuge theyre working on barriers but not barriers that would impede wildlife and large animals like jaguars at 6 foot 6 with steely blue eyes dressed in leather chaps astride his mule rancher warner glenn is every inch the american cowboy and he is a man forever changed by his encounters with the jaguar he has written a book eyes of fire about his experience he says hed like to invite mr bush to come out on a mule so he can see whats going on here in these mountains for glenn the cat represents all that is wild about the southwest it would be a loss to me that maybe my granddaughter or my daughter wouldnt be able to see one like i have its just an animal thats a beautiful magnificent cat and theyre having a little bit of trouble surviving but theyre doing it and i would hate to see us do anything that would cause the survival of that cat to go backwards im a livestock rancher but i wouldnt mind donating a few calves to that jaguar so to speak biologist emil mccain agrees they are part of our natural heritage they are part of the american west they are part of the american wild as much as the bald eagle or the grizzly bear and the jaguar is really special because it is such an elusive and beautiful creature that it evokes a sense of

national security adm michael mcconnell gov sarah palin is in new york to meet with leaders from around the world the appearances with world leaders taking place on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly meetings in new york come as the campaign of republican presidential nominee sen john mccain tries to convince voters that palin is ready for the world stage palins top foreign policy adviser informed reporters of the meeting at a small briefing after palins visits with afghan president hamid karzai colombian president alvaro uribe and former secretary of state henry kissinger the adviser stephen biegun formerly a top member of the national security council under president bush characterized the intelligence briefing as routine and said it was the sort of meeting that is standard for candidates for the vice president and president biegun said several officials were present to brief palin although palin held photoops with the leaders she refused to take questions from any reporters the alaska governor initially said that no reporters would be allowed to sit in on her meeting with karzai she planned to allow in only photographers and one television crew but she changed her position after at least five us news networks protested cnn does not send cameras into candidate events where editorial presence is not allowed nonetheless biegun said these are relationships that she intuitively understands are very important for the next president and vice president of the united states in those gettogethers palin kept the focus primarily on energy issues and the growing influence of russia according to biegun palin found kissinger particularly engrossing their meeting had been scheduled to last 30 minutes but the two met for nearly an hour and a half in talking to dr kissinger biegun said she certainly had a lot of questions about how the united states can develop a cooperative relationship with russia what are some of the unique challenges to the current state of russias political development and having been in particular some of the recent developments weve seen with russia backsliding democracy russias incursion into georgia asked about her meetings with karzai and uribe biegun said palin liked them very much and established a great personal rapport with karzai palin chatted for half an hour about mccains desire to send more us troops to afghanistan with uribe she listened for about 20 minutes as the president discussed the countrys security situation and its handling of guerrillas according to biegun rather than make specific policy prescriptions she was largely listening having an exchange of views and also very interested in forming a relationship with people she met with today biegun is helping prepare palin for her debate with democratic vice presidential nominee sen joseph biden on october 2 in st louis missouri he would not say what specific topics palin was concentrating on in her study sessions james hoge of the council on foreign relations said the palin meetings are meant to show just as democratic presidential nominee sen barack obama did when he went to germany and gave a speech in berlin that she is comfortable on the international scene that she can hold her own in conversations with foreign leaders  watch whats on palins agenda   democrats warn that palins carefully scripted photoops some of which will include mccain could backfire by bringing attention to the holes in her rsum the big risk that they run with this strategy of having her meet with these leaders individually is that they end up with three days of stories about how she doesnt have foreign policy experience said hilary rosen a democratic strategist and cnn contributor but republicans point out that palin is just following in the footsteps of other national candidates such as ronald reagan and bill clinton former governors who needed to beef up their international policy credentials the first thing you do is burnish their foreign policy credentials you buy them a randmcnally you meet with generals you get a lot of flags on the stage and you give a big speech on foreign policy to display you have some command of the world said alex castellanos a republican strategist and cnn contributor as a 44yearold governor who just got her passport last year she has had to fend off accusations that she is not up to speed on foreign policy in a recent interview with abc she admitted that she has never met with a head of state asked last week for specific skills she could cite to rebut critics who question her grasp of international affairs she replied i am prepared i have that confidence i have that readiness palin told voters at a townhall meeting in grand rapids michigan and if you want specifics with specific policies or countries you can go ahead and ask me you can play stump the candidate if you want to but we are ready to serve mccain stepped in pointing out that as governor of a state that has plenty of oil and gas palin was familiar with energy she knows it to be one of our great national security challenges he said he also cited her nearly two years as commander of alaskas

0fbf368e42ee268d0ed54582264d462d51a7eb2b,moscow russia cnn   the somali government has asked russia to intervene against pirates who have seized a ukrainian cargo ship the somali ambassador to russia said wednesday the us navy released this observance  photo of the mv faina which is loaded with weapons and tanks but the russian navy issued a statement later in the day saying it had no intention of using force against the pirates the russian news agency interfax reported the questions of freeing the ships and crew are being dealt with in line with the corresponding international practices interfax quoted navy spokesman igor dygalo as saying for understandable reasons the use of force would be an extreme measure because it could threaten the life of the international crew of the ship the pirates took over the mv faina last week off the coast of somalia and are demanding a 20 million ransom for the ships cargo of 33 sovietmade t72 tanks tank artillery shells grenade launchers and small arms the ship is anchored within somalias 12mile territorial limit the government and the president of somalia are allowing the russian naval ships to enter our waters and fight against pirates both in the sea and on the land that is if they would have to chase them amb mohamed handule said at a news conference in moscow we think that this issue of piracy has exceeded all limits it is very dangerous that pirates are now laying their hands on arms  not just for somalia not only for the navigating but for the entire region in general he added right now pirates are controlling the sea in this area but just imagine if they get control of the land too the announcement raised concern among some officials monitoring the situation  watch russian warships move to confront pirates   we may have bad news said andrew mwangura of the kenya seafarers association mwangura said some of the ukrainian crews family members are concerned for their loved ones safety and have called him to see if he can communicate with the pirates he urged negotiations to continue for the safety of the crew members mwangura said let the ship owners talk with the pirates  watch mwangura talk about the rise in pirating   a russian navy ship sailing toward the faina is in the atlantic ocean and still has a bit of water to get here said us navy lt stephanie murdock who is stationed in nearby bahrain there is no estimated time of arrival yet the us navy has several ships in the area monitoring the situation there have been no changes today murdock said the navy has not communicated with the russian ship but will work out coordination when it arrives murdock said the russian ship neustrashimy is headed to the region solely to protect russian shipping according to the russian navy spokesman the navy command has been stressing that the neustrashimy from the baltic sea fleet has been given the task of arriving in the area of somalia and guaranteeing for a certain time the safe seafaring of russian ships in the area with a high risk of pirate attacks the essence of the mission is to prevent the seizure of russian ships by pirates dygalo said handule the nigerian ambassador seemed to criticize the united states for not taking action ships of more than 10 countries are now close to our shores but we are not satisfied with the results of their activities he said citing un security council resolution 1816 handule said we are inviting all countries all states who have possibility to support somalia to fight against  pirates we are especially inviting russia and giving special status to russian warships to fight to help somalia the latest developments came two days after three pirates were killed when they started shooting at each other according to mwangura the kenya maritime official the shootout centered on a disagreement between moderate and radical pirates aboard the ship mwangura said the moderates wanted to surrender but the radicals did not the pirates hijacked the ship off the coast of somalia september 25 the faina had been headed to the kenyan port of mombasa after departing from nikolayev ukraine and was seized not far from its destination the faina is owned and operated by kaalbye shipping ukraine and its crew includes citizens of ukraine russia and latvia the navy said abdi salan khalif commissioner of the coastal town of harardhere told cnn the pirates told a group of town elders that one crew member had died of high blood pressure problems attacks by pirates have increased dramatically in the waters off somalias northern coast in the past year prompting the us and other coalition warships to widen their patrols in the region three ships were hijacked on august 21 in that area the worst number of attacks in a single day in many years capt pottengal mukudan of the international maritime bureau told cnn after the spate of attacks the us navys fifth fleet in bahrain announced that it would begin patrolling a newly established shipping corridor in the gulf of aden in an attempt to protect international shipping canada also sent a warship through the end of september the international maritime bureau said in april that 49 pirate attacks on ships were reported in the first three months of 2008 compared with 41 for the same period last year it recorded 263 pirates attacks last year up from 239 the year before and the first

careerkiller clay aiken recently announced he was gay on the cover of people magazine now out gays and lesbians are as casually visible as the cover of people magazine which has recently run stories on ellen degeneres wedding to portia de rossi and clay aikens decision to discuss his sexuality so in a time when selfdeclared bisexual tila tequila can have a highly rated mtv show on looking for a partner of either sex lindsay lohan talks about her relationship with dj samantha ronson and star treks george takei can have a very public wedding with his longtime partner is coming out still a big deal publicist howard bragman author of the forthcoming wheres my fifteen minutes portfolio says that it is every person that comes out is another barrier coming down bragman who is openly gay told cnncom acceptance by the mainstream public he observes is easier but by no means automatic particularly when issues such as gay marriage are at stake i look at it as a longterm process the revolution is over  now its an evolution  watch american mornings lola ogunnaike look at changing attitudes   bragman was around when a performer revealing his or her homosexuality could still shock he helped guide dick sargent when the bewitched star came out of the closet in 1989 and remembers when it was difficult to get support for movies such as philadelphia the 1993 film that won tom hanks an oscar as a lawyer dying of aids now he observes there are gay actors  how i met my mothers neil patrick harris may be the most notable  playing straight roles something that would have been almost unthinkable even a few years ago since studios have often been nervous casting known gay performers in straight roles  well buy hanks as a gay man but not the opposite  bragman describes the industry thinking indeed there are now more gay characters in primetime television than ever shows such as ugly betty the office and greys anatomy feature gay or bisexual characters and this fall five more will hit the airwaves bringing the total to 16 according to a study by the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation glaad its certainly positive that there is such a dramatic increase glaads president neil giuliano told cnn number one it reflects society and the fact that we are more visible and it also makes good television portrayals are almost more honest and real peter sprigg vice president of policy for the conservative family research council doesnt agree im convinced that for the most part these characters are placed on television for propaganda purposes in order to persuade people to be more accepting of homosexual conduct he told cnn in that sense the result for society is likely to be negative but bryan batt the gay actor who plays the closeted salvatore romano on the emmywinning mad men says that viewers are more accepting of gay characters today though concerns linger yes i did think maybe this going to hurt me careerwise to come out but i come from broadway and a lot of theater background so you know no one really cares  you dont have to be straight to act straight you dont have to be gay to play gay he told cnn  watch batt talk about the challenges of a gay actor   but he adds there is i think a little bit of homophobia i do believe that through education and seeing good honest positive gay role models it will just educate i think we are producing generations now of youth that do not judge people they dont judge people on their race or their religion or their sexuality april woodard a correspondent for inside edition told cnn headline news showbiz tonight that rejection may have been on aikens mind the singer a bornagain christian had long declined to talk about his sexuality and with a strong middle american fan base may have been afraid of a backlash there are definitely going to be some people in the south where he lives that arent going to agree with it and some of the christians are not going to agree with his lifestyle and even having a child out of wedlock she said for his part aiken  who recently became the father to a newborn son  told people that coming out was the first decision i made as a father i cannot raise a child to lie or hide things  ive never intended to lie to anybody at all the fans if they leave they leave but if they leave i dont want them hating me bragman believes aiken will be more successful than ever im sure anecdotally youll have people not buying the next aiken album because hes gay but it will be statistically insignificant if youre a fan youre a fan he said aiken and other gay celebrities have generally received support from their colleagues and the public heroes star kristen bell who is straight told cnn that aiken shouldnt really have to acknowledge it what surprises and saddens me is that it still is big news she said but bragman observes that the decision to come out remains intensely personal its not a career move  its a personal move he said its saying i need to do this for me  there are still many performers and industry notables he says who threaten to sue if their sexuality is revealed others live gay social lives but dont talk about their sexuality  the socalled glass closet and as bragman notes gay stars are generally from the second tier there are still no alist movie stars out of the closet there are still no superstar athletes he said its great to see how far weve come he said and we all long for the day when its a nonstory but were not there yet,"stars such as clay aiken admitting theyre gay not shocking anymore

been part of the olympics on and off since ancient times when women were banned from the bulk of the games the greek historian pausanias of damascus said that if a spectator was uncovered as a woman in male disguise she was duly escorted off the premises and thrown off a cliff in later games the athletes started performing naked and the crowd was also ordered to disrobe it has been suggested that this was to ensure that they were all men in the modern olympics there has been less disrobing  and not much crossdressing either gender tests have been normal procedure since 1966 for athletes not spectators so they couldnt really get away with it before that time one of the strangest  and most controversial  cases was polish sprinter stanislawa walasiewicz aka stella walsh who set 11 world

life by claiming to be pregnant and even revealed a baby boy they later lived as a family the happy couple was eventually arrested for espionage in 1983 and shis secret was revealed crying game style to the stunned boursicot but how did they have this romance for so long without bousicot knowing the truth officially they rarely made love and always did it hurriedly and in darkness  something that boursicot always ascribed to shis demure chinese upbringing one theory however is that he always knew the truth but played dumb to conceal his homosexuality he later came out the affair was the basis
