star michael vick is set to appear in court monday a judge will have the final say on a plea deal earlier vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in virginia your admitted conduct was not only illegal but also cruel and reprehensible your team the nfl and nfl fans have all been hurt by your actions nfl commissioner roger goodell said in a letter to vick goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over in papers filed friday with a federal court in virginia vick also admitted that he and two coconspirators killed dogs that did not fight well falcons owner arthur blank said vicks admissions describe actions that are incomprehensible and unacceptable the suspension makes a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the nfl will not be tolerated he said in a statement  watch what led to vicks suspension   goodell said the falcons could assert any claims or remedies to recover 22 million of vicks signing bonus from the 10year 130 million contract he signed in 2004 according to the associated press vick said he would plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture in a plea agreement filed at us district court in richmond virginia the charge is punishable by up to five years in prison a 250000 fine full restitution a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release the plea deal said federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines the defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense the plea agreement said in an additional summary of facts signed by vick and filed with the agreement vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won most of the bad newz kennels operations and gambling monies were provided by vick the official summary of facts said gambling wins were generally split among coconspirators tony taylor quanis phillips and sometimes purnell peace it continued vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by bad newz kennels  vick also agreed that collective efforts by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs around april vick peace and phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at vicks property in virginia the statement said peace phillips and vick agreed to the killing of approximately 68 dogs that did not perform well in testing sessions at 1915 moonlight road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods including hanging and drowning vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of peace phillips and vick the summary said peace 35 of virginia beach virginia phillips 28 of atlanta georgia and taylor 34 of hampton virginia already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences vick 27 is scheduled to appear monday in court where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge  see a timeline of the case against vick   the judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement the federal case against vick focused on the interstate conspiracy but vicks admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges according to cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin it sometimes happens  not often  that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior toobin said friday the risk for vick is if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea the state of virginia could say hey look you admitted violating virginia state law as well were going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court  in the plea deal vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests vick agreed to make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated with the dogs that are being held by the government such costs may include but are not limited to all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case including if necessary the longterm care andor the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals prosecutors with the support of animal rights activists have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs but the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against vick and his admitted coconspirators judge henry e hudson issued an order thursday telling the us marshals service to arrest and seize the defendant property and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property both the judges order and vicks filing refer to approximately 53 pit bull dogs after vicks indictment last month goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the falcons

holding out for 30700 for one of his kidneys doctors in pakistan have been arrested for abducting people drugging them and stealing their kidneys they are not so unusual a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with endstage illnesses to poorer places like china pakistan turkey egypt colombia and the philippines to buy a new lease of life lee a 53yearold chief subway technician in hong kong was diagnosed with liver cancer in january 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread a friend told him about a transplant hospital in chinas north eastern tianjin city and he signed up for a place that april he paid 260000 yuan 34380 for a transplant  surgery that saved his life the hospital has connections with a lot of prisons lee told reuters mine came from an executed prisoner from heilongjiang i thank the donor deeply the world health organization estimates that 21000 liver transplants are carried out annually but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90000 demand for kidneys also exceeds supply and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and transplant tourists who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living a donor in south africa receives 700 for a kidney compared with 30000 in the united states a lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on or at least regulate the trade but even where the trade is banned laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes which are sometimes defended by vested interests and the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor  especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donors liver the complications can include bleeding infection even death in the transplant trade the recipient need not worry about for example exposing a living relative to that risk it is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you dont have to care for someone you dont know once you pay it is discarded in a way it is dispensable said luc noel a genevabased coordinator for clinical procedures at the world health organization china recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year only 20000 transplants are carried out in china each year of these 3000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors china defended its use of organs from executed prisoners saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families a transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around 33000 in china what is important is the transparency it has to be open to scrutiny  if china makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent that would do good said the whos noel in asia a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs excluding china asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year said lo chungman professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the university of hong kong pakistan where trade in human organs is not illegal is turning into a kidney bazaar said the chief executive of pakistans kidney foundation jaffar naqvi there are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but naqvi said there were 13 centers in lahore alone which reported more than 2000 transplants last year from bought kidneys patients mostly from europe saudi arabia and india pay about 500000 rupees 8500 for a new kidney he said donors are paid 300 to 1000 and often get no medical care after the surgery there is no consent in some cases in may police arrested nine people four of them doctors for abducting people drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations in the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a nonrelative with no payment such a clause allowing altruistic organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors naqvi said stories of people selling their organs especially kidneys are not uncommon in egypt where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line karam who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure he said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30000 egyptian pounds 5300 the fees of the doctor were 5000 pounds both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the donor received said karam he said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients lists abdelkader hegazy head of the disciplinary committee at the doctors union said egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence the law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment we at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back he told reuters it is an annoying and a regrettable situation wellknown doctors and professors are doing this they are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values the union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities but the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years

a speech at a memorial service here is his speech in full  william and i can separate life into two parts there were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father princes harry and william greet guests at a thanksgiving service in memory of their mother and then there are the 10 years since our mothers death when she was alive we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life laughter fun and folly she was our guardian friend and protector she never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated she will always be remembered for her amazing public work but behind the media glare to us just two loving children she was quite simply the best mother in the world we would say that wouldnt we but we miss her she kissed us last thing at night her beaming smile greeted us from school she laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day she encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure she  like our father  was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood to lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age as others have experienced is indescribably shocking and sad it was an event which changed our lives forever as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night but what is far more important to us now and into the future is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was funloving generous downtoearth entirely genuine we both think of her every day we speak about her and laugh together at all the memories put simply she made us and so many other people happy may this be the way that she is remembered prince williams reading from st pauls letter to the ephesians  i bow my knees before the father from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name i pray that according to the riches of his glory he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his spirit and that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith as you are being rooted and grounded in love i pray that you may have the power to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of christ that surpasses knowledge so that you may be filled with all the fullness of god now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations for ever and ever amen thanks be to god the bishop of londons speech  whos cheating the scene is an old peoples home two residents are playing beggar my neighbor enter the princess the question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room one tiny incident characteristic of countless other occasions in the princesss public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort everyone here will have their own memories i remember meeting princess diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in st pauls even archbishops chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and i was nervous entering the presence it must have been a bewildering time for the princess as well but even then at the age of 20 her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated prince harry has spoken movingly and justly as few others have the right to do about the princess as a mother i want to dwell for a moment on her public work its cost and its meaning after her marriage the princess joined her natural gifts of beauty empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the royal family generates led by our queen and other members of the royal family our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century there is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but doesnt intrude but there is another sphere vital to any sense of national unity and creativity a sphere in which communities must be celebrated common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored we tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is gods will but if noone can articulate in an unignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in christ the human face of god then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society and at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech and the princess brought her own gifts to this work she was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the middlesex hospitals aids ward it was the first in the uk and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded aids in the 80s those familiar with the field have no doubt that the princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin and she had a similar impact in the usa an editorial in the new york times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign and even a royal dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the us her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the ottawa convention banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children she proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which of course have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries and as she said in her words the biggest disease today is not leprosy or tb but the feeling of being unwanted she sought out places of suffering because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way bill deedes accompanied her on some of her visits his response to the cynics was typically robust he said she was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well she was good at this because she herself was vulnerable she knew the feeling she didnt set out to be a saint the role brought great power but like any member of the royal family she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over ones personal humanity is a desperately difficult task as we have heard from prince harry his mother diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead she confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched she said of john a young greek suffering from cystic fibrosis he showed no sign of anger no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that i have never before encountered the love of christ described in the lesson read by prince william contains the essence of the spiritual life princess diana recognized this quality of life in many of those like john whose lives she touched it was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out and the mystery is this  the more you go beyond yourself the more you will become your true self the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others the more you will find yourself the more you keep company with those who suffer the more you will be healed this is the knowledge which passes all understanding this is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints its easy to lose the real person in the image to insist that all is darkness or all is light still 10 years after her tragic death there are regular reports of fury at this or that incident and the princesss memory is used for scoring points let it end here let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion let us also echoing the words of prince harry look to the future and pray in the words of st paul for all those who serve our country as members of the royal family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her  i pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of god amen email to a friend ,"prince harry describes princess diana as the best mother in the world

ddcdeb9bdd19fa23f9495c85d48eeee910f33102,washington cnn  a wideopen presidential race and a willingness by candidates interest groups unions and corporations to buy tv time will lead to historic spending for political and issueadvocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle an analysis shows former massachusetts gov mitt romney has spent the most on tv advertising so far among presidential contenders the cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed 3 billion according to tns media intelligencecampaign media analysis group cnns consultant on political television advertising this is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issueadvocacy television advertising rang in at 17 billion in 2006 23 billion was spent on political and issueadvocacy tv commercials just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money said evan tracey cmags chief operating officer the costs to produce a tv commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters  see how spending breaks down for this year   and interest groups have spent 62 million on tv ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures on the national level the cost of issueadvocacy television ad spending was 270 million in the first nine months of this year subjects ranged from the iraq war to telecommunications reform television ads on health care alone total 60 million cmag estimates more than 3 million of the 270 million spent to air issueadvocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive house and senate races in 2008 tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode what we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries and through the general election is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates he said with 17 democratic and republican candidates running for president cmag predicts that more than 800 million will be spent on tv ads in the battle for the white house up to now the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of iowa new hampshire and south carolina voters in some of the 20plus states holding nominating contests on february 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months former massachusetts gov mitt romney leads all candidates in tv spending having aired his commercials more than 11000 times this year at a cost of nearly 86 million this is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle  watch how romney is way ahead in ad spending   in contrast one of romneys chief rivals for the gop nomination former new york mayor rudy giuliani has spent nothing on television ads but giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition while romney does not in the race for the democratic nomination illinois sen barack obama has spent more than 23 million on television commercials while new york sen hillary clinton has spent 1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls new mexico gov bill richardson has probably benefited the most in the democratic contest from the 2 million he has invested in his television commercials richardsons humorous tv ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker diplomat and executive and positioned him as a solid secondtier candidate romney used his 86 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to republican voters these voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal massachusetts romney is leading polls in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire further evidence of how romneys television commercials have helped is in south carolina an american research group poll of south carolina republicans in august showed romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters a month later and with 350000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll romney was up 17 percentage points romneys latest ad began airing friday in iowa and in it he vows to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons to boost the military by 100000 people to strengthen us intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the us from al qaeda all of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the iowa caucuses while only a handful of democratic candidates and romney have used the airwaves until now tracey said he expects this to change before the end of october i suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air tracey said as we get closer to primary day the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last best shot in the fight for congress cmag predicts that as much as 639 million could be spent on television advertising democrats control the house and senate tracey noted that cmags 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former florida rep mark foleys house page scandal or the september 11 terrorist attacks politics is completely beholden to events he said events will ultimately determine how much is spent where and when what television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months chances are just as what happened in 2006 voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads said stuart rothenberg editor of the nonpartisan rothenberg political report the sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance after a while the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise email to a friend ,"amount almost

they tried to put the children on a plane to france where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in three french journalists a sevenmember spanish flight crew and one belgian were also arrested representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with zoes ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission chadian president idriss deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed his chief of staff mahamat hissene said thursday the president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of abeche where the children were taken to a judge in ndjamena the capital hissene said the transfer will take place monday according to media reports the international red cross committee the un high commissioner for refugees and unicef said most of the children were living with their families before zoes ark took them the charity said the children were sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a wartorn nation the agencies said most of the children also probably come from chadian villages along chads border with sudan the children have been living in an orphanage in abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities  watch a report on whether the children are orphans   chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities chads interior minister said zoes ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help the charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted the spaniards and belgian are charged with complicity the spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released a company executive said thursday we thought we were doing a humanitarian transport said antoni cajal sales director of spains gir

the first problem of its kind for the company which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue cajal said on its web site zoes ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in paris that sends teams of physicians nurses firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in france who then apply for asylum on their behalf the red cross unhcr and unicef said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10 and they are healthy the agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds so far the interviews carried out with the children  some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age  led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from chadian villages near the cities of adre and tine along the chadiansudanese border the agencies said ninetyone children said they had been living with their family consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent the agencies said adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing the agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children their youth and the situation in the region other french charities earlier had questioned whether zoes ark could legally arrange adoption of children from darfur and contacted french authorities according to french newspapers and the associated press french authorities have reacted angrily to the zoes ark trip calling the groups actions illegal and irresponsible

such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity even wonder perhaps but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer the island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier but such a large amount of ice melted it revealed the distinct island i very quickly realized two things he told cnns anderson cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year one was that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change the other thing was that it meant it was really happening it wasnt a joke it wasnt just statistics it was really happening he calls his discovery warming island many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the earths climate are the result of an increase in the worlds temperature a trend widely called global warming many global warming experts say the phenomenon if unchecked is capable of altering the worlds climate and geography in the worstcase scenario experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels flooding cities and altering seashores other scientists and observers a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planets life most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere but why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious the earths temperature averages about 60 degrees fahrenheit about 16 degrees celsius the average surface temperature has warmed one degree fahrenheit 06 degrees celsius during the last century according to the national research council the temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910 according to the us environmental protection agency they rose till about 1945 cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day there are several possible reasons for the warming scientists say a change in the earths orbit or the intensity of the suns radiation could change triggering warming or cooling the reason most cited  by scientists and scientific organizations  for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planets temperature at a comfortable level the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for instance has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age according to the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change commonly referred to as the ipcc the presence of methane is now 151 percent above preindustrial levels but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades according to the epa meanwhile nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities like the burning of fossil fuels emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests for the last 30 years theres no way theres anything natural that can explain it stephen schneider a professor of environmental studies at stanford university in california said a vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community  will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming he added many scientific organizations share schneiders view ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the g8 to the national research council the american meteorological society and the american geophysical union but there are those who do not share his view and among the skeptics is richard lindzen a professor of atmospheric sciences at the massachusetts institute of technology weve suddenly taken to reading tea leaves he said when we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970 we were proclaiming global cooling since then theres been a few tenths of global warming so were proclaiming global warming he believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal the earth is always getting colder and warmer he said its always changing in fact this is true of any fluidcovered planet asked about glacial melt which many observers point to as evidence of global warming lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained we dont know why but its perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that theyve occurred he said what were doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying thats occurring due to global warming yet for schneider it is a cause for concern and alarm were already in serious melt nobody can explain it the models dont predict it he said we dont know whats going on up there all we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty the greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the worlds nations the ipcc in february 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to preindustrial levels temperatures could rise between 36 to 81 degrees fahrenheit 2 to 45 degrees celsius by 2100 the lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes droughts wildfires and flooding schneider said the higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of hollywood filmmakers uncertainties however plague such forecasts which are based on computer simulations and models the models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere oceans and continents interact all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them exactly how much its going to warm up we dont know schneider said that its going to warm up id bet anything on that email to a friend ,"earth has warmed one degree

the perfect way to describe invisalign is netflix for your teeth is right  the things we do for beauty so how did you like being transformed into three such different looks kh it was fun i was working with such great hair and makeup people and to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat is do you ever go without makeup kh there was a time when i would now that i get followed by photographers im really paranoid about it i do not want to be the look what this celebrity looks like without makeup picture im clearly vain and i dont need that plus i like products is how often do you go through your drawers and purge kh often because people send me a lot of stuff now which is exciting i love getting those boxes into the tape recorder send me a box of makeup stila when that happens i feel like i have to clean out and give stuff to my sister mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that i cant accept is how do you think you express your personality through style kh im a big hairup person last night at work they put my hair in two french braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap i thought it looked cute and that i could pull it off after id slept on it and  no so i thought i could recreate it myself  no again as far as clothing style goes i fluctuate almost as much as i do with beauty products i like to shop for sweaters  maybe its the new englander in me im building a house in the mountains in utah so i tell myself im preparing for that i like sweaters  theyre like scrubs  you dont have to suck it in or worry about the bloat is do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding kh i have an idea but its so dependent on the dress and i havent gotten there yet my sister is getting married too so we looked for dresses together after about five stores i was like im done everyone says you just know when you put that dress on my sister found the right dress just like that so i know it can happen but its grueling is wait so your mom has two daughters getting married within months kh my poor mother is probably like why god why but i hired a planner i want the day to be spectacular but mostly i want it to be fun and i dont want to freak out or stress is does your fianc have any particular opinions about your look kh josh wouldnt mind if my hair was brown if it was still long  thats such a boy thing is would you ever wear a wig out kh id contemplate it but i dont know if i actually have the courage to pull it off i once wore a long hairextension ponytail and someone asked me if it was real like i was one of those dolls when we were little and the hair just cranks out is how would you describe your skin kh my skin is sensitive so everything bothers it and im the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse is how do you treat a breakout kh i got a great product at ona spa called sebuspot ive tried so many that were disappointments but maybe i stand too close to the mirror examining my pores if i backed up things might look fine is what do you always carry in your bag kh powder because i get shiny and lip balm either the smiths rosebud salve or co bigelows mentha lip shine in black cherry soda from bath  body works its shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good is an in stylecom reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in hollywood kh i train

up a huge outcry actors can be so touchy in response he issued this correction i have been misquoted what i really said is actors should be treated as cattle although it began accidentally when he was short an actor for the film the lodger hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career ayn rand  the egotists egotist author ayn rand born alissa zinovievna rosenbaum is the patron saint of thinking youre better than everybody else her most famous novels the fountainhead and atlas shrugged are massive dramatizations of objectivism her selfspun oscarthegrouch philosophy for success objectivism champions ego and accomplishment shuns all religion as folly and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society rands novels often focus on protagonists invariably men who are shunned by others because of their genius but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant not surprisingly she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as spitting in your own face so just how much did rand believe in her own philosophy lets

a150e93fa52eaba281aae9eabe28b3ee4155f296,london england cnn  there are some circuits that are cornerstones of the formula 1 calendar the monacos and silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers then there are the newer circuits  malaysia and bahrain for instance  but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins fuji speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view next week they have something completely new to contend with a track that has yet to see a single f1 team put in a single lap the japan grand prix is to return to the fuji speedway a circuit that hasnt seen an f1 race since 1977 though now with a substantially different track layout the fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games the old fuji speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game pole position released by namco in japan and atari in the rest of the world the most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of mount fuji japans tallest mountain looming in the distance though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies the suzuka track  which had held japanese grands prix between 1987 and 2006  had been popular with drivers and fans alike but for this year and the next the japanese grand prix will be held at fuji however an announcement by formula one management fom this month revealed that suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009  on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications  with the location of the japanese grand prix alternating yearly between fuji and suzuka after that behind the scenes is a political battleground  both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with f1 connections  honda owns suzuka toyota owns fuji toyota is a relative newcomer to f1 but having this year surpassed general motors as the worlds number one automobile manufacturer and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock a position that hasnt been reflected in sporting success it is not without clout the redesign of the fuji track was carried out by hermann tilke in 2003 tilke a german architect redesigned a number of f1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including malaysia istanbul bahrain and shanghai and the tracks for 2008s debut grands prix in singapore and valencia so how do f1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as fuji without data from previous races to fall back on the answer lies with computer simulation computeraided design cad is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the hightech cars every bend every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself despite never having raced on the circuit the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual fuji speedway for some time bmw saubers simulation experts received cad data from the japanese race organizers late last year and when their cars arrive at fuji for testing next week their race setup should be close to optimum the circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments the radius of each individual segment was measured allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated the slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car in order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance says willy rampf technical director of the bmw sauber f1 team dieter glass chief race and test engineer with toyota f1 explains  you start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit once you know that you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce before you get into more detailed simulations of different setup solutions getting a bit closer to the weekend you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy this prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track like the degradation of the two bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time if you have more fuel in the car this affects your lap time but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried one peculiarity of the fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight which at 1475 km 0916 miles will allow for higherthan averagestraight line speeds but after the straight the track is relatively twisty the teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight and the best grip decelerating into the bends you have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip says glass and as always you want good grip in general but you have to balance that with the long straight where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed the testing may be virtual but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hairs breadth away from real world eventualities  our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values says rampf not that everything can be predicted i think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race continues glass many incidents can happen which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy email to a friend ,"redesigned fuji speedway to host its first japanese grand prix since 1977

hired a bodyguard for his sons wedding and never leaves home without a 45caliber handgun strapped to his chest keith reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case the man who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of keith reynolds for domestic abuse  even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family a report in the denver post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of colorado paul logli chairman of national district attorneys association told congress this year that witness intimidation has become almost epidemic according to the denver post when asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of colorados witness protection program the witness in the reynolds case said all they told us was maybe we should move im pretty sure i told one of them  either him or his wife  about the program i cant remember if i gave them all the details the prosecutor assigned to the case who didnt want to be named told cnn after reynolds conviction the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home they received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked the couple received a death threat from reynolds himself through the mail watch witness describe fear of being targeted   reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation however it is likely hell be released within five years no national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist and minimal research has been conducted on the subject the latest national institute of justice survey on record  conducted more than a decade ago  shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem colorado has 50000 allocated to its witness protection budget in contrast the city of denver spent almost 100000 on landscaping last year the state on average spends about 1000 per witness that figure supposedly includes moving expenses rent and furniture the federal program spends in excess of 40 million per year on witness protection one possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities as do federal witnesses its not designed to be a longterm relocation at the publics expense its a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses according to peter weir executive director of the colorado department of public safety colorados witness protection program is a joke according to the rev leon kelly founder and executive director of the open door youth gang alternatives kelly says the state doesnt provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward more than a decade ago a young man named darryl givens asked kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison givens chose to testify a few months later he

instantly rhonda fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program she confronted prosecutors after his murder fields told cnn i asked them what happened why werent any measures taken to safeguard his life and i was told he never asked for any protection javads mother does not think it was her sons responsibility to ask for protection i think its the authorities responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness she said fields case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting javad fields personal information be kept secret but it wasnt signed by a judge until one year later after defense lawyers had already given the suspects fields personal information along with crucial trial documents i felt like the das office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life rhonda fields told cnn

debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month with five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season the republican candidates engaged in a freeforall trying to differentiate their views on immigration the iraq war abortion gun control and even whether they believed every word in the bible was true unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on democratic frontrunner hillary clinton wednesday nights attacks were launched at each other former new york mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov mitt romney traded jabs over illegal immigration something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month romney attacked giulianis record saying that as mayor he promoted illegal immigration and giuliani shot back accusing romney of having a sanctuary mansion at his own home  watch the debate format produce raw moments   in his case there were six sanctuary cities he did nothing about them there was a sanctuary mansion  at his own home illegal immigrants were being employed giuliani said romney denied giulianis allegation and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other in his quest to appeal to the hardline immigration wing of the party romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former arkansas gov mike huckabee who has been rising in the polls rep tom tancredo who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration seemed delighted with the give and take saying the other candidates were trying to outtancredo him huckabee drew one of the nights largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the internal revenue service most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging and theres a reason why he said sen john mccain freshly back from a visit to iraq over thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates and rep ron paul the most antiwar of the candidates tangled on two occasions over the iraq war  did  youtubers get their questions answered   asked which government programs they would cut paul said bringing the troops home from iraq would save a trillion dollars mccain said its that kind of isolationism that caused world war ii which drew some hoots from the crowd  watch mccain paul spar on iraq   paul replied the real question you have to ask is why do i get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel a retired brigadier general keith kerr who is gay asked candidates if they thought us military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops cnn later learned that a june media release from the campaign of democratic  frontrunner clinton listed kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters  watch kerr deny that the clinton campaign influenced his question   david bohrman cnn senior vice president and executive producer of the debate said we regret this incident cnn would not have used the generals question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate political ticker  kerr told cnn after the debate that he has not worked for the clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself kerr also said he is a member of the log cabin republicans a national gay and lesbian republican grassroots organization prior to the debate cnn had verified kerrs military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate in a section of the debate about gun ownership rights three of the gop presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns mccain giuliani and romney former tennessee sen fred thompson quipped i own a couple of guns  but im not going to tell you what they are or where they are  watch the candidates address gun control   the debate turned personal when a viewer holding the bible asked do you believe every word of this book and i mean specifically this book that i am holding in my hand huckabee a baptist minister said sure i believe the bible is exactly what it is giuliani said he believes the bible but not literally true in every respect after that romney stammered a bit when moderator anderson cooper asked him if he believed every word  watch the candidates get personal about the bible   yeah the bible is the word of god  i might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word but i read the bible and i believe the bible is the word of god romney said when asked about abortion romney said he was wrong in favoring a womans right to choose  his position when he was elected governor of massachusetts if people in this country are looking for someone whos never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit theyre ever wrong theyre going to have to find somebody else on abortion i was wrong he said his remarks came in response to the 30second video produced for the debate by thompsons campaign which included a clip of romney expressing support for roe vs wade during a 1994 debate against sen ted kennedy when asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal  paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government we dont need a federal abortion police thats the last thing we need paul said he added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities on the issues of taxes thompson said hed never met a tax he liked ive got a taxcut bill on the table but i dont do pledges to anybody but the american people he said his response was met by a go fred go from a member of the audience on the issue of trade with china rep duncan hunter said china is cheating on trade  and its in the interest of the united states to stop chinas cheating buy american this christmas season  that might keep your neighbor from losing his job the

deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back mildred and eduardo gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported his wife faces deportation to guatemala  her home country that she hasnt seen since 1989 he also doesnt know what would happen to his young son eduardo jr if that happens i like being in uniform and serving my country but if she goes back im going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job he said defending the country thats trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind gonzalez who works on helicopters that bring cargo supplies and military personnel in and out of iraq testified before a house judiciary committee panel last month detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his where military members families could be deported while theyre defending their country overseas  watch theyre tearing families apart   i want to serve my country 100 percent but with this issue in the back of my mind i feel i cant do that he testified on september 6 the us military does not have a policy to deal with such cases each is handled casebycase not by the military but by immigration authorities the government doesnt have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar  to gonzalezs immigration officials also said marrying a us citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to us citizenship or permanent legal status lt col margaret stock a member of the us army reserves who teaches immigration law at the us military academy at west point new york said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members you got to understand when youre in a combat zone you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy you cant be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where youre never going to see them again she said stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases on the one hand the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas on the other hand the same government is trying to deport the very same people whats happening right now is because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws weve got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home she said in gonzalezs case his wife mildred came to the united states with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old they were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from guatemala in september 2000 mildreds mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application her mother was granted legal status in july 2004 according to gonzalez however six weeks earlier gonzalez and mildred got married canceling mildreds ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21 as a result her legal status still remains in jeopardy a judge in june granted her a oneyear extension to remain in the united states if her legal status does not change by june 8 2008 she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation thats just fine according to mark krikorian the executive director of the center for immigration studies which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration what youre talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces and thats just outrageous he said what were talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military  theres no justification for that kind of policy gonzalez said that type of response is unjustified im trying to make his country better  my country better  and it should be her country too gonzalez himself entered the country legally crossing the mexican border with his family when he was about 10 he joined the navy as a socalled greencard sailor and became a us citizen in july 2005 the military does accept some immigrants who arent us citizens i understand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained but on the other token there are times when the situation is just out of their reach gonzalez said his wife mildred added we didnt come here to break the law we just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else us army sgt emmanuel woko a member of the armys 2nd brigade 1st infantry division who faces his third tour in iraq understands just how gonzalez and his family feel his wife and children could be sent back to nigeria my heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to nigeria while i am deployed in iraq he said i am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought thats a sentiment echoed by gonzalez we are not asking for anything we are just asking for our families to stay with

up federal funds for families affected by the wildfires in seven counties in southern california i will continue to make sure that our efforts are coordinated that we are responding to the needs of people but most importantly i want the people in southern california to know that americans all across this land care deeply about them he said the action follows an emergency declaration by bush on

security secretary michael chertoff acknowledged tuesday that the governments response machinery had benefited from the katrina experience i think theres no question that there were a couple of the lessons from katrina which we have put into effect here chertoff said first of all planning and preparation in advance for these kinds of challenges so that we have worked together and planned together with the defense department and with state authorities well in advance of the crisis thats been a big help here chertoff said  second we have really flooded the zone as quickly as possible by staging assets to deal both with the firefighting issue and with the response issue chertoff said chertoff said federal officials began discussing over the weekend the need to have fema ready and as we saw the evacuation issue becoming more prominent and the number of people seeking shelter becoming more prominent we sprang into action yesterday so weve been monitoring the situation continuously the presidents been on top of it weve been on top of it and were going to continue to stay ahead of this as far as we can chertoff said tuesday that he hadnt waited for the paperwork to be signed before staging assistance we have been moving cots blankets other supplies into the area of san diego so that we can handle any necessity for additional sheltering capacity he said weve also moved air assets to be poised to take flight when we do have the opportunity to deal with the fire once the winds begin to die down people left homeless by the fires can already go online to apply for federal help at  paulison said  watch paulison discuss the new fema   he denied suggestions similar to those made in the aftermath of katrina that the federal response was hampered because national guard equipment was in short supply because of the iraq war i just havent seen that he said the us military has sent aircraft to help fight the fires including 11 defense department helicopters equipped with water buckets and six c130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant more than 17000 national guardsmen have been made available 550 marines were ready for deployment from camp pendleton
