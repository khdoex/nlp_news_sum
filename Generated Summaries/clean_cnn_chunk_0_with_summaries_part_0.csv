star michael vick is set to appear in court monday a judge will have the final say on a plea deal earlier vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in virginia your admitted conduct was not only illegal but also cruel and reprehensible your team the nfl and nfl fans have all been hurt by your actions nfl commissioner roger goodell said in a letter to vick goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over in papers filed friday with a federal court in virginia vick also admitted that he and two coconspirators killed dogs that did not fight well falcons owner arthur blank said vicks admissions describe actions that are incomprehensible and unacceptable the suspension makes a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the nfl will not be tolerated he said in a statement  watch what led to vicks suspension   goodell said the falcons could assert any claims or remedies to recover 22 million of vicks signing bonus from the 10year 130 million contract he signed in 2004 according to the associated press vick said he would plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture in a plea agreement filed at us district court in richmond virginia the charge is punishable by up to five years in prison a 250000 fine full restitution a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release the plea deal said federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines the defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense the plea agreement said in an additional summary of facts signed by vick and filed with the agreement vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won most of the bad newz kennels operations and gambling monies were provided by vick the official summary of facts said gambling wins were generally split among coconspirators tony taylor quanis phillips and sometimes purnell peace it continued vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by bad newz kennels  vick also agreed that collective efforts by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs around april vick peace and phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at vicks property in virginia the statement said peace phillips and vick agreed to the killing of approximately 68 dogs that did not perform well in testing sessions at 1915 moonlight road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods including hanging and drowning vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of peace phillips and vick the summary said peace 35 of virginia beach virginia phillips 28 of atlanta georgia and taylor 34 of hampton virginia already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences vick 27 is scheduled to appear monday in court where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge  see a timeline of the case against vick   the judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement the federal case against vick focused on the interstate conspiracy but vicks admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges according to cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin it sometimes happens  not often  that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior toobin said friday the risk for vick is if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea the state of virginia could say hey look you admitted violating virginia state law as well were going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court  in the plea deal vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests vick agreed to make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated with the dogs that are being held by the government such costs may include but are not limited to all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case including if necessary the longterm care andor the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals prosecutors with the support of animal rights activists have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs but the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against vick and his admitted coconspirators judge henry e hudson issued an order thursday telling the us marshals service to arrest and seize the defendant property and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property both the judges order and vicks filing refer to approximately 53 pit bull dogs after vicks indictment last month goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the falcons

0753a471e6908c35bcbc2daa37e21f3a8443b590,hong kong china reuters  paul lee got his liver from an executed chinese prisoner karam in egypt bought a kidney for his sister for 5300 in istanbul hakan is holding out for 30700 for one of his kidneys doctors in pakistan have been arrested for abducting people drugging them and stealing their kidneys they are not so unusual a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with endstage illnesses to poorer places like china pakistan turkey egypt colombia and the philippines to buy a new lease of life lee a 53yearold chief subway technician in hong kong was diagnosed with liver cancer in january 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread a friend told him about a transplant hospital in chinas north eastern tianjin city and he signed up for a place that april he paid 260000 yuan 34380 for a transplant  surgery that saved his life the hospital has connections with a lot of prisons lee told reuters mine came from an executed prisoner from heilongjiang i thank the donor deeply the world health organization estimates that 21000 liver transplants are carried out annually but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90000 demand for kidneys also exceeds supply and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and transplant tourists who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living a donor in south africa receives 700 for a kidney compared with 30000 in the united states a lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on or at least regulate the trade but even where the trade is banned laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes which are sometimes defended by vested interests and the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor  especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donors liver the complications can include bleeding infection even death in the transplant trade the recipient need not worry about for example exposing a living relative to that risk it is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you dont have to care for someone you dont know once you pay it is discarded in a way it is dispensable said luc noel a genevabased coordinator for clinical procedures at the world health organization china recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year only 20000 transplants are carried out in china each year of these 3000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors china defended its use of organs from executed prisoners saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families a transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around 33000 in china what is important is the transparency it has to be open to scrutiny  if china makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent that would do good said the whos noel in asia a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs excluding china asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year said lo chungman professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the university of hong kong pakistan where trade in human organs is not illegal is turning into a kidney bazaar said the chief executive of pakistans kidney foundation jaffar naqvi there are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but naqvi said there were 13 centers in lahore alone which reported more than 2000 transplants last year from bought kidneys patients mostly from europe saudi arabia and india pay about 500000 rupees 8500 for a new kidney he said donors are paid 300 to 1000 and often get no medical care after the surgery there is no consent in some cases in may police arrested nine people four of them doctors for abducting people drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations in the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a nonrelative with no payment such a clause allowing altruistic organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors naqvi said stories of people selling their organs especially kidneys are not uncommon in egypt where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line karam who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure he said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30000 egyptian pounds 5300 the fees of the doctor were 5000 pounds both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the donor received said karam he said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients lists abdelkader hegazy head of the disciplinary committee at the doctors union said egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence the law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment we at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back he told reuters it is an annoying and a regrettable situation wellknown doctors and professors are doing this they are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values the union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities but the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior muslim religious leaders on whether islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths in turkey students unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the internet selling their kidneys listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type these wouldbe donors say they have had enquiries from germany israel and turkey with asking prices going up to 50000 lira 38760 hakan a 27yearold security guard in istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published told reuters he received
